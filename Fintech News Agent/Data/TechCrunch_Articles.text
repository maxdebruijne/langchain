Context: A Texas judge issued an injunction today to stall the enforcement of an online age verification bill.
The Free Speech Coalition, along with adult video sites like Pornhub, led the legal challenge against Texas’ HB 1181, arguing that the bill violates the First Amendment and infringes on rights guaranteed by Section 230.
“The Court agrees that the state has a legitimate goal in protecting children from sexually explicit material online,” wrote judge David Alan Ezra in the junction. “But that goal, however crucial, does not negate this Court’s burden to ensure that the laws passed in its pursuit comport with established First Amendment doctrine.”
Sponsored by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, the bill would make porn sites check users’ IDs to be sure that only adults are accessing sexually explicit materials. The bill would also require that these websites display a “public health warning” in 14-point font or larger, which states that watching pornography can cause mental illness and increase the demand for prostitution and child sexual exploitation.
“Although these warnings carry the label ‘Texas Health and Human Services,’ it appears that the Texas Health and Human Services Commission has not made these findings or announcements,” wrote Judge Ezra.
Many states have enacted laws in the last year that attempt to keep children away from inappropriate content by age-gating adult websites. But digital privacy advocates have voiced concerns for many years about the ways in which online ID verification can backfire.
While HB 1181 does not allow companies or third-party verifiers to store retain identifying information about its users, this is difficult to guarantee or enforce.
“Once information is shared to verify age, there’s no way for a website visitor to be certain that the data they’re handing over is not going to be retained and used by the website, or further shared or even sold,” explains the Electronic Frontiers Foundation, a nonprofit advocating for civil liberties online.
When a similar law passed in January in Louisiana, Pornhub conducted age checks via LA Wallet, a state-run digital drivers’ license app. So, in order for an adult to access one of the web’s most popular porn sites, they would have to share their government-issued ID.
Adult sites can be fined for not complying with these laws. Under the bill in Texas, for example, the Attorney General can sue websites for $250,000 each time a minor is found to have accessed sexual material.
Other laws like this have taken effect in Mississippi, Virginia and Utah. Learning from what happened in Louisiana, Pornhub decided to go dark in those states altogether. Instead, users will see a safe-for-work video in which adult actress Cherie DeVille explains why Pornhub doesn’t support age-verification as a way of keeping minors safe online.
“While safety and compliance are at the forefront of our mission, giving your ID card every time you want to visit an adult platform is not the most effective solution for protecting our users,” she said in the video.
Sites like OnlyFans and Pornhub require adult actors to prove their age and identity to cut down on nonconsensual content and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Still, Pornhub remains at the center of several pre-existing lawsuits regarding CSAM. But other porn sites have even fewer safeguards to ensure that actors aren’t uploading exploitative content.
The judge’s decision in Texas marks a departure from the precedent set by other states. But numerous other online age-verification bills like the Kids Online Safety Act are currently being considered.
“We’re pleased that the Court agreed with our view that HB1181’s true purpose is not to protect young people, but to prevent Texans from enjoying First Amendment protected expression,” said Free Speech Coalition Executive Director Alison Boden in a statement. “The state’s defense of the law was not based in science or technology, but ideology and politics.”

If you’ve been dreaming about bitcoin spot ETFs, it’s time to talk to someone outside of the crypto world. This is coming from someone who literally had a dream about them this week. Pray for me. 
There were cheers throughout the crypto community this week as Grayscale won its lawsuit against the SEC in regards to its bitcoin spot ETF application. While there’s still a 45-day review period, many believe this is a step in the right direction.
Although this was a win for the digital asset firm, the SEC was also making headlines separately for its suit against an NFT project, which was fined $6 million.
Meanwhile, in decentralized social media land, the Friend.tech hype — which I covered and highlighted community skepticism about — has fallen as daily transactions plummeted. Details below.

For this week’s new episode, Jacquelyn interviewed Craig Salm, chief legal officer at Grayscale Investments.
Grayscale is a digital asset investment firm that aims to provide products and services, like its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), to institutional and individual investors. The company was founded in 2014 and is one of the world’s largest digital asset currency managers. It currently owns 3.4% of outstanding bitcoin, “worth tens of billions of dollars,” according to a recent legal filing.
As mentioned above, the firm was making headlines this week after the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Grayscale in a lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the matter of a bitcoin ETF. This ruling is in response to the SEC denying Grayscale’s application to convert its GBTC product into a bitcoin spot ETF in June 2022.
We discussed why the ruling matters for Grayscale and its GBTC investment vehicle; as well as what it could mean for the crypto ecosystem and other firms like BlackRock, Citadel and Fidelity that also filed applications for bitcoin spot ETFs.
We also talked about the SEC’s argued difference between bitcoin futures ETFs, which have been approved by the agency, and bitcoin spot ETFs, which have not been approved by the agency.

Link: https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/31/salesforce-slowing-acquisitions-profitability-growth/
Context: For a long time, just about every company was focused on growth over everything. Then, as the economy began to turn last year, that focus shifted pretty dramatically to profitability and being more financially sound. Salesforce was no different.
Salesforce had been spending big over the prior years, acquiring companies like Slack for $27.7 billion, Tableau for $15.7 billion and MuleSoft for $6.5 billion, effectively buying growth in the process. Meanwhile, during the pandemic, like other large tech companies believing the work-from-home phenomenon would drive cloud profits long-term, Salesforce hired big, increasing the number of employees by 30% between 2020 and 2022.
As the cost of doing business increased with higher interest rates combined with inflation and currency headwinds, it had an impact on just about every company’s revenue growth, including Salesforce’s.
Then last year, activist investors started taking a close look at Salesforce, forcing the company to rethink its growth strategy in the wake of a shifting economic landscape and activist demands for more financial discipline.
CEO Marc Benioff steered the company through that turbulence by shifting its approach from the earlier growth orientation to one more focused on profitability. That meant cutting costs, which unfortunately resulted in laying off 10% of the workforce. In addition, the company announced in March that it was disbanding its M&A committee, a strong signal that the days of buying growth were over (at least for now).
For better or worse, the approach appears to have worked, with three consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. The circling activists backed off in March after a quarter in which the company reported 14% growth year-over-year. This quarter wasn’t quite that good at 11% growth, but it beat Wall Street’s expectations and even Salesforce’s own projections by a fair amount, leaving Benioff very satisfied during the post-earnings call with analysts.
“So, listen, as we’ve shared with you over the last couple of earnings calls, Salesforce has really accelerated our transformation to profitable growth,” he said during the call. “I think that’s super clear from the numbers, and I couldn’t be more excited, especially on this huge top-line beat and what our margin is looking like today.”
Salesforce disclosed a top-and-bottom beat on Wednesday, besting expectations in terms of both revenue and profit. The company reported $8.60 billion in total top line, ahead of an anticipated $8.53 billion result. And it earned $2.12 per share, ahead of an expected $1.90 worth of adjusted per-share income.
That revenue result represented 11% year-over-year growth. More impressive, though, was how much Salesforce bolstered its profitability. Net income shot up from $68 million in the year-ago period to $1.27 billion in Salesforce’s most recent quarter.
That massive profitability gain was not predicated on one-time gains from nonoperating results. In simpler English, the company’s huge spike in profits was earned the old-fashioned way: keeping costs low while growing revenue.

Context: YouTube Music redesigned its “Now Playing” screen recently, with the most notable update being a new comments section, which allows users to read and write comments directly from the app. The latest upgrade also includes easily accessible buttons, larger cover art and more.
The redesign is rolling out to iOS and Android devices today, per a company spokesperson.
As spotted by 9to5Google, YouTube Music launched a new comments button that shows existing comments from the official music video on YouTube. Users can also type their own, which adds a more engaging social component to the app.
The comment button is located under the cover art. When a user selects the button, a panel slides up on the screen.

Next to the comments are icons for like/dislike, save, share, download and radio, which were previously hidden and only accessible when users tapped on the album cover. Moving the buttons underneath the title of the song makes it easier to access.
Another small change is that the song/video toggle is now white instead of matching with the background color.
The redesign follows the launch of “Samples,” YouTube Music’s new TikTok-style short-form personalized video feed that features YouTube’s catalog of official music videos as well as live footage.

Link: https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/31/x-plans-to-collect-users-biometric-data-along-with-education-and-job-history/
Context: X, formerly known as Twitter, will begin collecting users’ biometric data, according to its new privacy policy that was first spotted by Bloomberg. The policy also says the company wants to collect users’ job and education history. The policy page indicates that the change will go into effect on September 29.
“Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes,” the updated policy reads. Although X hasn’t specified what it means by biometric information, it is usually used to describe person’s physical characteristics, such as their face or fingerprints. X also hasn’t provided any details about how it plans to collect it.
The social network was named in a proposed class action suit last month alleging that X wrongfully captured, stored and used Illinois residents’  biometric data, including facial scans, without consent. The lawsuit alleges that X “has not adequately informed individuals” that it “collects and/or stores their biometric identifiers in every photograph containing a face.”
In addition to the new changes about biometric information, X’s updated policy says it will start storing users’ employment and education history as well.
“We may collect and use your personal information (such as your employment history, educational history, employment preferences, skills and abilities, job search activity and engagement, and so on) to recommend potential jobs for you, to share with potential employers when you apply for a job, to enable employers to find potential candidates, and to show you more relevant advertising,” the updated policy reads.
This move appears to be linked to X’s beta feature that allows verified organizations on the platform to post job listings on their profiles. The social media giant has also created an official @XHiring account. The hiring initiative is part of Musk’s plans to turn X into an “everything app.”
X did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

Link: https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/31/forever-21-data-breach-half-million/
Context: Clothing giant Forever 21 said a data breach earlier in the year affects more than half a million individuals.
A data breach notice filed with Maine’s attorney general said the fashion giant was hacked over a three-month period beginning early January 2023, during which intruders obtained files from its systems. This data included the personal information of current and former employees, said Lorena Terroba Urruchua, a spokesperson for Forever 21 via public relations firm FTI Consulting, in an email to TechCrunch.
According to the notice, Forever 21 notified 539,207 people that the breached data included their name, date of birth, bank account number, and Social Security number, as well as information regarding employees’ Forever21 health plan, including enrollment and premiums paid.
Forever 21 did not describe the incident beyond an breach of its systems, but noted that, “Forever 21 has taken steps to help assure that the unauthorized third party no longer has access to the data.” It’s not clear how Forever 21 obtained this claim of assurance. The ambiguous wording of the notice could imply the company paid the hacker in exchange for deleting the data.
It’s not uncommon for ransomware and extortion groups to threaten to publish the data they steal if the victim does not meet a ransom demand, but security experts have long said it’s not possible to trust that a threat actor has deleted the data as claimed.
Forever 21 spokesperson Terroba Urruchua declined to comment further.
Forever 21 has about 500 retail locations and an online store. It’s the second data breach in recent years after a massive theft of credit card numbers from its store point-of-sale machines in 2017.
Last week, retail giant Shein and Forever 21 announced a partnership that would allow both brands to reach each others’ customers, including a deal by Shein to acquire about a third of Forever 21’s operator, Sparc Group. It’s not clear if news of Forever 21’s data breach would affect the partnership.
Corrected to note that only current and former employees affected, not customers.

Context: Google Play Points, the marketplace’s rewards program first introduced in 2019, is announcing its latest line-up of perks and deals at its second annual Google Play Live event this afternoon. Of particular interest, the points Android users collect will now be able to be redeemed for offers from partners outside of Google itself, including Walmart+, DoorDash and Discord.
When first launched, Play Points were designed to offer perks to customers downloading new apps, subscribing to services, and buying movies, books, and more from the Play Store. In return, they’d receive points that could be redeemed for things like in-app purchases or used as credits that could be put toward renting movies or buying an audiobook, among other things.
The program was originally launched in Japan and South Korea in 2018 and 2019, respectively, before making its way to the U.S.
More recently, Google updated the program to offer other more tangible perks, including the ability to redeem points for things like Google t-shirts, socks, water bottles and other items. It also began offering “partner” rewards, like discounts at delivery services like DoorDash and Instacart.
Those offers will now continue, as Google adds Walmart+ and Discord to its list of partners.
Google says the ability to redeem the partner rewards from Walmart+, DoorDash and Discord will be available in the weeks ahead, however — not immediately. They’ll also only be available to Platinum members (people who have 3,000 points or more). The perks 6 months will include a Walmart+ membership, 6 months of DashPass by DoorDash, or 6 months of Discord Nitro. Members won’t need to cash in their points to gain these perks, Google says.
In addition, Google Play Points will now be able to be redeemed with 10 game developers for in-game items in titles including Lord’s Mobile: Kingdom Wars, PUBG MOBILE, Match Masters, Evony: The King’s Return, and Clash of Clans. Points can also be used as a booster in these games that gives you 8x points on their in-game items for seven days.
Plus, the company will introduce offers on various popular apps and games, including Bumble (an extended Spotlight special), Candy Crush Saga (2x added value on select rewards), Duolingo (one-month free trial), Gardenscapes (up to 80% savings on special events), and RAID: Shadow Legends (50% more material rewards and essential resources).
Correction, 8/31/23 4:00 pm et: Instacart is no longer a perk with the program. Article updated to reflect this.

Link: https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/31/openai-angles-to-put-chatgpt-in-classrooms-with-special-tutor-prompts/
Context: OpenAI wants its conversational AI agent ChatGPT everywhere, and that includes classrooms — despite the immense potential for misuse and confusion there. Taking the bull by the horns, the company has proposed a few ways for teachers to put the system to use… outside its usual role as “research assistant” for procrastinating students.
The chatbot is controversial due to the dubious use case of unknown prevalence: plagiarism. Teachers around the world have caught or suspected students of having their essays written by ChatGPT, or using it to answer things like take-home quizzes. Depending on your opinion on educational methods this may be considered cheating, fair play, or something in between, but it is definitely throwing a wrench into lesson plans around the world.
Clearly OpenAI wants to rehabilitate the system’s image a bit when it comes to education, so it has offered up a selection of, honestly, pretty compelling ways to put it to work in the classroom.
For instance, ChatGPT can be used to help language (especially English) learners to translate and write clearly and correctly. The system may not always get its facts right, but thanks to a corpus of largely correct writing, it is grammatically correct even while hallucinating. I’ve heard this before from people who aren’t native speakers of English and there’s no reason to think it wouldn’t be as useful to a 5th grader as it is to an adult.
OpenAI also repeats experts saying (it is careful to put this in the context of educators making these suggestions themselves) that it could be helpful for formulating new test questions or role-playing as a job interviewer.
Perhaps the most relevant suggestion, from Geetha Venugopal in Chennai, India, is to teach kids that they shouldn’t trust everything a computer spits out at them:
In her classroom, she advises students to remember that the answers that ChatGPT gives may not be credible and accurate all the time, and to think critically about whether they should trust the answer, and then confirm the information through other primary resources. The goal is to help them “understand the importance of constantly working on their original critical thinking, problem solving and creativity skills.”
If those kids can learn that, they’ll be doing what half the planet can’t!
Notably, in a FAQ, the first (and surely most frequently asked) question is about recognizing AI-generated content presented as a student’s own work.
To OpenAI’s credit, words are not minced:
Do AI detectors work?
In short, no. While some (including OpenAI) have released tools that purport to detect AI-generated content, none of these have proven to reliably distinguish between AI-generated and human-generated content.
They warn against asking ChatGPT or other systems questions like “did you write this?” as total misconstructions of what the model actually does. And they admit that “small edits” are enough to avoid detection. Like removing the “As an AI, I…” bit that the laziest plagiarists fail to notice.
OpenAI scuttles AI-written text detector over ‘low rate of accuracy’

OpenAI recommends having students show their work and drafts, including conversations with AI models, and demonstrate that they are not simply asking it for answers and trusting them blindly. (If they were in M. Venugopal’s class, they would know this.)
The company also helpfully includes some extensive prompts to put ChatGPT in the role of a tutor or assistant: “You are a friendly and helpful instructional coach helping teachers plan a lesson,” and so on. While educators may not want to use these straight out of the box, simply reading them is suggestive of what kind of direction the agent needs in order to be helpful but not too helpful.
It’s certain that AI agents like ChatGPT will be a fixture of education going forward, even if unfortunately there is great opportunity for abuse. But then again, who can say they did not install games on their TI-83 graphing calculator, or copy their report on Napoleon wholesale from Encarta? Well, a fair amount of young people, probably. But although I date myself, the parallels are clear. Students and teachers will adapt — but only if they embrace the tools and make them their own.

Link: https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/31/bumble-changes-its-policy-to-crack-down-on-bots-ghosting-and-doxing/
Context: Dating app company Bumble has released its updated community guidelines with an aim to crack down on bots, spam, ghosting, and doxing. The new policy will apply to its dating app Badoo along with Bumble.
The platform is revamping its rules to weed out bots by banning actions like artificially influencing “connections, matching, conversations, or engagement through the use of automation or scripting.” Bumble specified that it has blocked over 8.2 million accounts this year across its properties — a majority of them through the company’s AI to detect fake and spam accounts.
Bumble has been investing in various efforts to develop machine-learning models to make its platform safer. Last year, the company open-sourced its algorithm to detect unsolicited nudes.
The dating app is also adding clauses to prohibit adult content on its apps including content in profiles or attempts to buy, sell, or promote sexual content.
In addition, the company is cracking down on ghosting and will now count a “no-show” on dates — when two people agree to meet and one of them doesn’t show up with any intimation — under “bullying and abusive conduct.”
In a previously published help page about ghosting, the company had simply asked users to see it as the other person’s loss.
“Bumble believes in being real about the imperfect nature of dating. We fully get that ghosting can be disappointing or frustrating, but sometimes it happens,” the page had said. “If someone suddenly stops messaging you, see it as their loss and an opportunity to find someone better for you.”
Bumble said that it is also updating its guidelines to include acts like doxing and victim-blaming as rule-breaking offenses of its service under the “Physical Violence and Bullying” policy. This will apply to all company properties — Bumble, Badoo, and the newly released Bumble For Friends (BFF) app.
The company hasn’t provided details on whether it also plans to update its reporting options and flow to reflect the changes in community guidelines. Additionally, it will face challenges in tackling off-platform violations of some of these rules.

Context: Things continue to look up for European fintech giant Klarna. Around this time last year, it would have been hard to say that.
Alex Wilhelm explained the ins and outs of Klarna’s first-quarter earnings in May, along with a little history on its rather tense 2022 when the company’s valuation was hit and it had layoffs.
Today the company, best known for its buy now, pay later offerings, has additional good news: It reported a profitable month in the second quarter as gross merchandise volume grew 14% to 238.6 billion Swedish Krona ($21.8 billion) from 209.2 billion ($19.1 billion) Krona in the same quarter in 2022.
Revenue in the second quarter grew at an even faster pace, up 17% to 5.5 billion Krona ($502.2 million), up from 4.7 billion Krona ($429.1 billion) in the year prior period. The company’s total operating income increased 21% compared to the period a year ago.
Meanwhile, Klarna reported that its credit losses continued to improve after decreasing by 41% compared to the second quarter in 2022, noting “our responsible lending approach has enabled us to maintain credit losses at continued low levels of 0.39% of GMV in the first half of the year, as revenue and GMV continued to grow.”
Mary Ann Azevedo reported in June 2022 about Klarna’s — and its competitor Affirm’s — efforts to attract U.S. customers, here and here. Those seem to still be paying off for Klarna so far: The company reported that the second quarter represented its third consecutive quarter of gross profit in the U.S. Even more so buoyed by a new relationship with Airbnb to offer flexible payments for guests. That offering is now expected to expand into Europe soon.
CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski told TechCrunch in an interview that Klarna has built a “healthy, robust business model,” and that the company has been thinking about profitable growth, especially amid investor sentiment shifting in that direction over the past year.
“We had to make some painful decisions a year ago,” Siemiatkowski said. “We have since focused on optimization, and that has paid off, especially now that we have three consecutive quarters of growth in the U.S.”
He also noted that Klarna was affected by the overall flat growth of the e-commerce industry in the past year, particularly in more of its mature markets in Europe where 50% to 80% of the market is using Klarna.
Looking forward, Siemiatkowski said that Klarna’s long-term strategy was designed with the intention of betting on multiple features and continued innovation.
“By having a buy now, pay later offering with zero interest at the point of sale, people will continue to find value, but you can’t bet the whole business on it,” he said. “For example, our customers, when they open up their purchase history, see images of the items they bought, and they like that. We have to keep coming up with features like that.”

Context: Meta is continuously experimenting with features to bump up engagement on Threads, which has fallen off after the initial rush of excitement and installs. In the latest test, the company is showing a carousel of suggested Threads posts on the Instagram app.
As noted by many users across the world, Instagram is now showing a “For you on Threads” carousel with a button to open the app directly on your phone.

Meta confirmed this test to TechCrunch in a comment.
“We have added a number of new features to the app since launch, and are now making it easier for people to see the latest content from Threads directly on Instagram,” a company spokesperson said.
Earlier this month, Meta added a “Send to Instagram DM” button on Threads to directly share posts with your friends on Instagram.
Last week, Meta officially introduced Threads on the web with features like the ability to quote posts still missing. This was a highly anticipated launch to encourage frequent posters to be more active from their desktop. Data from analytics company Similarweb suggests that until now, that move hasn’t brought in a ton of users. After the launch, week-over-week user gains in the U.S. (+133,400) were larger than the dip in active app users (-82,400), but this could be a result of existing users switching from mobile to desktop.
As Reuters reported earlier in the month, in an internal company town hall, Chief Product Officer Chris Cox said that to battle falling numbers on Threads, the company would add  “retention-driving hooks” such as “making sure people who are on the Instagram app can see important Threads.” The new carousel on Instagram seems to be part of that plan.
Earlier today, Meta also started testing a feature in Australia and New Zealand to let people search for posts on Threads. The company said it plans to make the search available in English-speaking countries soon.

Context: Adam Savage of MythBusters fame has a Savage Rule of Tools: If you think you need a new tool, buy the cheapest one you can find. Then, when it breaks or wears out, you’ll have a much better picture of how you use the tool and how often you need it.
It’s a counterintuitive form of common sense. Living by that rule, however, illustrates how awful a lot of products are. It’s ridiculous how many times I’ve ordered something from AliExpress only to realize it is of terrible quality and often not fit for the purpose. Still, “poorly made by the cheapest bidder” is the name of that game, so perhaps terrible quality isn’t that surprising. What I find far more worrying, though, is how often midrange products are, in a word, useless.
Sitting with this reminded me of the boots theory. Terry Pratchett’s take on that theory in the Discworld series (Book 15, Men at Arms) presents a profoundly simple and poignant illustration of economic inequality and the implications of short-term versus long-term investment. Paraphrased, the theory argues that it’s cheaper to buy expensive, high-quality goods that last a long time than buying cheaper, lower-quality goods more frequently.
However, as we traipse deeper into late-stage capitalism, a paradoxical phenomenon is taking shape. Despite economic prosperity enabling more people to afford high-quality goods, there seems to be an overarching trend toward lower quality and disposability. In a nutshell: Even if you can afford high-quality products that are designed and built to last, it’s becoming increasingly challenging to find and buy products that meet that bar.
Why is it that in a world rich in resources, technological advancements and consumer purchasing power, it’s becoming harder to find high-quality, durable goods? Why do companies continue to sell us products that are built to fail, ensuring we’ll need replacements soon enough?

However, significantly transforming your operations to harness the power of the cloud requires best practices, frameworks, a culture of collaboration, cost transparency, and much more.
The latest data bears out this complicated reality.
According to recent data from the FinOps Foundation, FinOps (financial operations) continues to proliferate within companies globally (including most of the Fortune 500). Where are these organizations in terms of maturity?
Nearly 68% of respondents are at the crawl stage, around 23% are at the walk stage, and 9% are at the run stage. And yet, Accenture research found only 42% have yet to achieve any material value from FinOps.
 

			While most IT leaders genuinely believe that FinOps is the answer to cloud cost complexity, it’s clear there is still a lot left to learn.					


Moreover, many cloud industry leaders believe they’ll have to wait years before seeing any positive outcomes from their FinOps practices — according to a recent study from CloudBolt Industry Insights (CII) conducted by Wakefield Research, 75% of respondents say they anticipate it will take 24 to 36 months.
Even so, there remains an unprecedented commitment to the cloud, with 86% of companies reporting an increase in cloud initiatives, according to the same Accenture data. So, while most IT leaders genuinely believe that FinOps is the answer to cloud cost complexity, it’s clear there is still a lot left to learn and build upon to make the best outcomes a reality.
The truth? FinOps is more than just a buzzword; it’s a mindset that brings together finance, operations, and engineering teams in perfect harmony. By fostering a collaborative culture of cost transparency, FinOps instills a sense of shared responsibility across departments, allowing organizations to make informed decisions and optimize cloud resources efficiently.
From this year’s FinOpsX conference and beyond, here are some best practice takeaways you can consider to help ensure your cloud transformation is successful across every metric, with FinOps at the forefront of every decision.
Create a CCoE or a team or group of individuals within your organization responsible for creating and implementing cloud-related best practices, guidelines, and governance policies.
Before beginning your cloud journey, this team should present a “state of financial health” using agreed-upon KPIs (key performance indicators) and discuss antipatterns, trends, and success blockers. It should comprise two cross-functional teams — often a cloud engineering team and a cloud steering committee.
Some key responsibilities of a CCoE include the following:
The efficacy of cloud-based initiatives hinges on the coordinated efforts of people, processes, and technology to fulfill their pledged value. Although roles like cloud architects and other cloud-focused personnel are crucial for handling everyday cloud activities, it’s equally vital for business stakeholders.
This group includes members of the C-suite, finance, legal, procurement, and various other internal teams to understand cloud technology fully. This knowledge will help formulate the business’s most effective strategies and solutions.
Meet with your cost leaders regularly to review cost trends, set optimization goals, remove blockers, enable, and train. Think: cross-functional workshops, roundtable discussions, lunch and learns, and demos to get the conversation going.
If you’re feeling creative, develop a friendly competition among different departments or teams through cloud cost gamification. Set cost-reduction goals and reward the teams that achieve the most significant savings through FinOps practices, fostering a sense of ownership and encouraging collaboration.
Empower cost leaders with round-the-clock access to cost management tools, enabling them to generate pertinent reports, dashboards, budgets, forecasts, and more.

Context: Instagram Threads users had been clamoring for a fully functional web version of the Meta-owned Twitter alternative since the app’s July debut. But last week’s release of the anticipated web app on August 22nd appears to have little significant impact on Threads’ usage, new data indicates. In the U.S., Threads’ website traffic jumped up by 20% over the past week (through Monday) compared with the week prior, but it’s not clear that this could be attributed to an influx of users, rather than to switchers moving from the native mobile app to the web.
Worldwide, the traffic bump from the web app launch was only 3%.

The data comes from digital intelligence firm Similarweb, which has been tracking Threads’ adoption and the subsequent tapering off in usage following the app’s blowout launch which saw it becoming the fastest app ever to reach 100 million users — a milestone it hit in just five days.
But since that time, Threads has seen traffic sink. Mobile intelligence firm Sensor Tower reported earlier this month that Threads’ daily active users had dropped 82% since launch, and there were now just 8 million users accessing the app daily. The launch of the web app was a chance for Threads to reverse this trend as users had said they wanted a way to use the service more easily from their desktop.
 
But it seems the web launch was largely catering to Threads’ existing audience. Similarweb says the week-over-wee
Image Credits: Similarweb
k gain in Threads website visitors in the U.S. (+133,400) was larger than the drop in active app users (-82,400), but it doesn’t have a way of determining the overlap between these two figures. However, it speculates this could indicate some current Threads users were likely moving from the app to the web.
In addition, its Android data indicates Threads’ daily active users were down 15% worldwide and 2.4% in the U.S., during the same week-over-week comparison. This also suggests that Threads’ web launch simply saw users switching from app to web, but didn’t necessarily bring in new users or see lapsed users returning.
Today, Threads announced it’s testing search in Australia and New Zealand — another in-demand feature that would make the app more useful when compared with X (formerly Twitter).
But even search may not be enough to lure users back to Threads or see it gain new ones.
The issues around Threads adoption demonstrate the hold that X still has on the text-first social networking ecosystem. Despite X’s many fumbles under Elon Musk, the app continues to offer a place where news breaks and trends are easily spotted — something that’s more difficult to find on a competitor like Threads without key features like search, hashtags, and trends. These are what give X the feel of a global conversation hub and a real-time news network, and aren’t as easy to replicate as simply building similar tools elsewhere.
For Threads to work, it also has to court the newsmakers and breakers to its platform, not just celebs you can already follow on Instagram. And so far, many of X’s active users have either remained on the app or scattered elsewhere to networks like Bluesky and Mastodon, or perhaps smaller rivals like T2, Spill, Post, and others. Completely leaving X has seemingly proven difficult for longtime users, whose social connections still remain on the platform. That means Threads will have to do more than build the features users want in an X competitor, it will need to find a way to convince people to actually make the switch and then stick with it.

Context: After the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of digital asset management firm Grayscale in a lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in regards to a bitcoin spot exchange traded fund (ETF), the firm’s chief legal officer Craig Salm expects the regulator to approve the ETF.
“It’s a matter of when, not a matter of if,” bitcoin spot ETFs will be approved in the U.S., Salm told me on TechCrunch’s Chain Reaction podcast.
The new verdict was in response to Grayscale’s lawsuit against the SEC, which denied the firm’s application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF on June 29, 2022. The court ruled 3-0 in favor of Grayscale, which currently owns 3.4% of outstanding bitcoin “worth tens of billions of dollars,” according to the legal filing.
“[The ruling] is a huge win for us, our shareholders and really the whole crypto community. Right now, we’re focused on finishing those final steps to get this conversion to happen,” Salm said. “I don’t think we should wait any longer to let that happen, especially now that we have this paving of the road to an ETF conversion.”
The exact timeline is difficult to predict, as the ruling is subject to a 45-day review period, Salm noted. But if there’s no “rehearing,” then it will be smooth sailing for the company. Bloomberg ETF analysts increased their odds from 65% to 75% that the SEC will approve a bitcoin spot ETF this year and are betting on odds of 95% by the end of 2024.
“My view is that this should happen as soon as possible because we have investors today. GBTC represents nearly a million investors across all 50 states,” Salm said. “But because the product is not an ETF today, it is trading at a discount.”

Context: Some customers of the network security company LogicMonitor have been hacked due to the use of default passwords, TechCrunch has learned.
A LogicMonitor spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that there’s “a security incident” affecting some of the company’s customers.
“We are currently addressing a security incident that has affected a small number of our customers. We are in direct communication and working closely with those customers to take appropriate measures to mitigate impact,” LogicMonitor’s spokesperson Jesica Church said in a statement.
The incident is due to the fact that, until recently, LogicMonitor was assigning customers default — and weak — passwords such as “Welcome@” plus a short number, according to a source at a company that was impacted by the incident, and who asked to remain anonymous as they were not authorized to speak to the press.
“When you set up an account with [LogicMonitor], they define a default password and all user accounts for your organization/account are made with that password,” the source told TechCrunch. “They also didn’t require the changes, nor were they temporary passwords, until this week. Now the setup password lasts 30 days and must be changed on first login.”
According to an email sent by one of LogicMonitor customers and seen by TechCrunch, “LogicMonitor had reached out to us proactively with a possible username/password breach for a few of their customers via a call, which could lead to systems that are being monitored by LogicMonitor to be compromised with a ransomware attack and henceforth this proactive reach out.”
LogicMonitor’s spokesperson said the company cannot share more details about the incident at this point.
The source said they are aware of a breached company that lost more than 400 systems due to a ransomware attack that exploited their weak default password.
LogicMonitor provides a software-as-a-service platform that gives customers visibility into their network infrastructure, including in the cloud. The company says on its official site that it “monitors 800 billion metrics per day across three million active devices,” and that “it has more than 100,000 software users across 30 different countries.”
Are you a LogicMonitor customer? Were you one of the victims of this incident? We’d love to hear from you.

Link: https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/31/uk-startup-backpedal-uses-gps-tracking-to-reclaim-stolen-e-bikes/
Context: New e-bike models keep coming off production lines with GPS tracking enabled, with the idea that such tech will deter theft and help you recover your bike if it gets stolen. But how exactly does knowing roughly where your bike is going to help you get it back?
“Customers don’t care if they can track their bike after a theft,” James Dunn, co-founder of e-bike recovery startup BackPedal, told TechCrunch. “Having a GPS tracker actually doesn’t enable their e-bike recovery. They think, ‘Well, the police won’t do anything. I don’t want to go get my bike back. So what’s the point?’”
In the hands of a single civilian who’s furious about their stolen property, perhaps GPS isn’t very useful. But in the hands of BackPedal, e-bike recovery seems like it might actually be possible.
The UK-based startup offers e-bike owners a monthly subscription service, which includes recovery of the e-bike and, more recently, insurance via Sundays Insurance, one of the largest cycle insurers in the UK. BackPedal says it has a 90% recovery rate, but the insurance provides a security net for the bikes that can’t be brought back.
The subscription starts at £8.99 per month but quickly climbs based on the value of a customer’s e-bike.
Such a product will become increasingly relevant as e-bike adoption, and thus e-bike theft, continues to rise. One cycling insurance specialist, Cycleplan, has seen e-bike insurance policies rise 292% between 2019 and 2022, according to a report from Cycling Industry News. But that doesn’t include the recovery operations, which the founders say is what most people want.
In their pre-business launch research, BackPedal found that 76% of potential customers would rather have their own stolen bike returned to them quickly, rather than going through the process of filing an insurance claim and getting a replacement bike.
“GPS has been done at scale,” said Dunn. “Nailing the recovery operations is the hard bit that hasn’t been done at scale.”
While BackPedal says its service is offered nationwide, most of the startup’s operations are in London and Cambridge, as well as along the UK’s southeast and south coast. One of BackPedal’s commercial fleet customers from the UK also wants BackPedal to deploy in Amsterdam, which will provide an opportunity to test scaling the recovery model in another country.
That model involves working with both the police and a network of recovery agents. The recovery agents are usually ex-police officers or security professionals, contractors who have their own security businesses, who know the lay of the land and have relationships with the local police.
Or sometimes it’s just Dunn and his co-founder Richard White pounding the pavement in search of bikes.
BackPedal has a remote operation center where someone receives the customer’s request, tracks down the bike on the back end, manages the recovery agents and liaises with the local police.
The agents will do anything from knocking on the door and confronting the potential thief to hopping over fences and stealing the bike back.
“They assess the situation, and if it’s not dangerous, we tell them to go for it and retrieve it,” White told TechCrunch. “If it’s dangerous, we tell them to wait for the police.”
Dunn said BackPedal has had success enlisting the help of police, despite the popular opinion that cops probably have better things to do with their time.
“It’s because we’re not private citizens; we’re actually BackPedal, a professional e-bike recovery firm, and we recover high-value stolen bikes,” he said. “We’re learning how we can manage the police and part of that is around not expecting things to happen straightaway.”
BackPedal follows a process to get the police involved. Once a theft report comes in, the startup then reports it immediately to the police, sharing all available evidence like the type of bike, how it’s being tracked and where it is.
“We let them know we’re professional. We’re not emotionally attached. We’re resourced and putting our people on the ground, and we’re not going away,” said Dunn. “Police do have a statutory duty to help with stuff like this.”
Ultimately, Dunn (whose parents were police officers) said bike thefts are a thorn in the side of communities, and he wants BackPedal to get to the point where it’s a trusted partner to the police.
Dunn says aside from building an on-demand network of recovery agents and integrating that with each police jurisdiction, BackPedal’s main challenge is getting the hardware right.
“What is the hardware that enables reliable recovery? How does that change by vehicle type and use case and geography?”
As e-bikes become smarter, they’re increasingly being built with IoT, GPS and Bluetooth trackers. Bikes with GPS from BikeTrax, IoT Ventures and BikeFinder are on the company’s approved tracker list because they are integrated within the bike (and thus can charge using the bike’s battery), have a backup battery, have proven coverage and can be third-party access-enabled.
For bikes that don’t have GPS installed, BackPedal offers an installation service — £225 for a professional fitting, or £150 for a fit at home guided by the team over WhatsApp.
GPS can only get you so close to a bike. It might tell you what apartment building it’s in, but can’t get you to the actual unit. That’s why BackPedal is also using additional beacon technology, which acts as a lighthouse that pings a signal every second via Bluetooth.
“It basically means we can see behind walls, and that’s something nobody is doing,” said White, noting that the signal starts to be picked up within 50 meters of the bike’s location via a smartphone.
One of the challenges for BackPedal as it grows is that the thieves will start to get better at what they do, so the startup will have to consistently deploy better hardware.
Since January, BackPedal has grown at an average of nearly 20% per month, the founders said. Today the startup has 500 customers, but the goal is to reach 1,000 subscribers in the next five months.
Adding the insurance was an important step for BackPedal in offering a more complete product that puts the startup in a better position to raise seed funding, a process BackPedal will consider starting in six months after growing the business more.
In the meantime, the company is working on healthy and sustainable growth. Learning each new market as it comes up, sourcing recovery agents and forming relationships with local police is essential to the process and will take time. Scaling will require a streamlined way to enter new markets, more GPS trackers on e-bikes, and continued work on the back-end software to manage the whole enterprise, said Dunn.

Context: Eve, the manufacturer of smart home devices that work particularly with Apple’s ecosystem and HomeKit, just unveiled a brand new device at IFA, a consumer electronics trade show. The Eve Play is a small AirPlay 2 receiver that can turn any traditional speaker into a smart, connected speaker. It will be available on November 14 for $149.95 (or €149.95).
From the outside, the Eve Play looks deceptively simple. There’s no screen, no on/off button and no remote. It’s a simple streaming box with an aluminum frame and a glossy black finish on the top of the device.
The back of the device is more interesting as it features plenty of ports. In addition to the power port, there are optical, coaxial and RCA audio outputs. This way, you can connect it to a wide variety of stereo systems.

When it comes to local network connectivity, the Eve Play is limited to Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n on 2.4 or 5 GHz networks). Fortunately, there is also an Ethernet port for reliable connectivity.
Once everything is set up, you will be able to connect to the Eve Play receiver from the audio output screen of your iPhone, iPad or Mac. The Eve Play will also appear in Apple’s Home app, which means that it could be used for home automation.
And because it supports AirPlay 2, it means that you can use it as part of a multi-room audio setup. For instance, you could have a HomePod in your kitchen, a Sonos speaker in your bedroom and an Eve Play connected to your stereo in your living room and play the same music across all your rooms.
While AirPlay 2 is supposed to automatically adjust latency between speakers, Eve will also let you manually set a latency in the Eve app. Behind the scenes, Eve uses a Texas Instruments digital-to-analog converter to turn your digital audio into an analog audio signal.
There are other audio receivers on the market from Belkin or Bose. Some of them offer more options, such as Bluetooth pairing. But if you’re looking for a clean and simple AirPlay 2 solution, the Eve Play could be an interesting option.

Link: https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/31/starfield-review-guns-and-ships-galore-but-a-vacuum-of-wonder/
Context: The long-awaited “Skyrim in space,” Starfield, is out today after many years in development over at Bethesda. It’s ambitious and lavishly produced, but despite its size it lacks the sense of wonder and vastness that its pastoral predecessor epitomized.
(I and my colleague Darrell both played the game and came away with differing impressions — he also played on console while I played on PC.)
Starfield follows the adventures of your character in the 2300s, when hundreds of star systems have been colonized but much of what’s out there is still unknown. You fall in with Constellation, a group of explorers on the trail of a set of mysterious artifacts that hint at a greater presence at work in the galaxy… and your destiny! (Minor early game spoilers ahead.)
Sound familiar? It should, as this is the general shape of half the space-based adventures out there. But where Starfield sets itself apart is in the scale of the game world and the player’s freedom to explore it, boasting an open galaxy of a thousand planets. Admittedly, other games also attempt to set themselves apart this way, but let’s move on.
Like Skyrim, once you get past a few initial missions that introduce the characters and mechanics, you’re more or less free to explore. But here we hit our first, and perhaps most important, issue.
While its august predecessor and other open world games like Tears of the Kingdom, Elden Ring, and Horizon: Forbidden West take place in huge, continuous lands dotted with points of interest, Starfield’s open world is spread over dozens of star systems and individual planets, which leads to a fundamentally less compelling form of exploration.
Dots… dots everywhere!
Instead of walking or riding (or as in countless other space exploration games, flying) from point A to point B and finding activities and locations as you go, you select locations from the map: system, planet, and landing location.
But you don’t actually fly there: the menu just takes you directly there via loading screen. I don’t feel like I’m exploring a vast galaxy so much as I’m ordering a stellar object a la carte. Hmm, I’ll try the Level 20 Atria VI, 2nd moon. And boom, there you are. Now land in the middle of nowhere and walk a few hundred meters to the only visible point of interest.
Maybe this won’t bother others as much as it does me. But part of the reason I play open world games at all is the sense of wonder, craft, and interconnectivity, best expressed in the (inevitable) moment your character steps out onto a precipice or out of a vault and the landscape opens itself up in front of you. That moment of wonder and anticipation simply doesn’t exist in Starfield. In a way the review can end there — with the game completely neglecting to offer what to me is one of the most important aspects of the genre. But that would be unfair, as Starfield undoubtedly has its charms.

For one thing, the actual locations are really beautifully realized. The environment and object design in this game is absolutely fantastic. The aesthetic is marvelous and the execution is impeccable. I’m doing a whole separate post on some of the wonderful gadgets, interfaces, doors, and other machines I’ve encountered — I never thought I’d look forward in a game to seeing how a new door opens, but it’s a joy every time in this game. Buildings are realistically laid out, with bedrooms and bathrooms, workspaces, kitchens, and chock full of ordinary objects and snacks. So many snacks. 
I also really enjoy the spaceship design, interior and exterior, so it’s a shame you seldom have any real reason to look at it. You can freely redesign your ship basically from scratch (Darrell’s favorite part, so I’ll let him elaborate on it), but ultimately when you’re in space combat you’ll probably be in first person, and the rest of the time the ship is just set dressing for your fast travel.
The cities, from shiny, clean New Atlantis to Cyberpunk-lite Neon and beyond, are also fairly impressive, with plenty of NPCs wandering around, mumbling about potential quests, and shops offering opportunities to stock up or commit various forms of theft.
And there are plenty of unique locations to explore on story missions, which are deliberately designed and full of character. “Environmental storytelling” is a Bethesda core competency and it shows here.
Non-flagship locations you find, however, tend to fall into one of a few categories: caves full of space pirates, abandoned facilities full of space pirates, and space stations full of space pirates. Some of them are mercenaries, or “spacers,” but unless you are currently on a faction quest for them or something, they’re all just spacesuits pointing guns at you.
So you’ll be shooting them a lot — there’s no other way forward most of the time. If you were hoping to sneak through vents or hack your way through, sorry. Though a few missions rely on these tricks, for the most part it’s kill or be killed. And combat is fun but pretty basic. You’ll trade shots with anonymous (but cool) looking spacesuits peeping out of cover, or flank them with your jetpack — always satisfying, even if it feels a little unfair against their simple AIs. Most areas have a boss spacesuit with multiple health bars: utter bullet sponges that can take dozens or hundreds of shots to wear down.
If this is a little disappointing to those hoping for a Deus Ex-style choose-your-own-adventure, I’m with you, but it bears remembering that the core gameplay loop of Skyrim was similarly “find a cave/tomb/base, annihilate all occupants and steal anything of value.” Eventually we all became stealth archers — same here, but without the stealth.
There’s a good variety of weapons, using a bewildering array of ammo types (some of which are rare but many of which you’ll have thousands of rounds of after a few hours), and you can freely modify them once you acquire the pertinent skill. I’ve had more luck picking up advanced guns by venturing into higher-level areas, but the freedom to opt at nominal cost for different ranges and styles is appreciated.

The main and faction missions have dialogue and some real rewards — which are interesting to find out on your own so I won’t spoil them here. Keep your expectations mid; it’s not much more impactful or interesting a story as Skyrim’s, nor is it better told, nor are the characters (including your immortal puppy-dog companions) much more memorable or helpful. But they’re better than the “task”-level side quests, which are thick on the ground and uniformly pretty weak.
I took on one of the first and seemingly simplest quest board tasks: to find a planet in a neighboring system that had some kind of solar seasons. Right away I’m thinking, despite every stellar object being inhabited long enough ago to have abandoned facilities of some kind, this information isn’t public record? Anyway, I had to visit each of half a dozen worlds and all of their moons individually (via menu) to scan them (via menu), then explore some on foot scanning everything in sight to find which had the “trait” — none, that I could tell. I gave up on this unrelentingly tedious quest and decided to never visit the board again.
But in the process, I found some interesting planets… just kidding. The planets were all pretty samey, and I found an exact copy of a facility I had encountered a couple hours earlier — a perfect copy in every respect, though the space pirates were of a different flavor. This has happened many times since then: same facility, same layout, same enemies, same dead scientists or colonists in the same positions, same chests in the same rooms. (All while your companion shouts the same battle cries and non sequiturs.)
On one moon-scanning surface expedition, I saw a ship land a ways off. I bounced over to see if I could help its occupants, or shipjack them. I found the captain ambling around a nearby building. She needed ship parts to fix their ship, she said. I didn’t have any. But ten feet away was an unlocked chest with one (1) ship parts inside (and some money and a gun, and some snacks). I gave her the ship parts, thinking perhaps this would be the start of a quest chain. She said “wow, thanks!” and continued her walk. The end!
And I found a moon called Worthless, presumably so-called because it is a barren rock with not only no life on it, but only two mineral resources to scan and collect; some planets have 6 or 7, plus as many flora and fauna to find. Nevertheless, what did I find but a science base — and amazingly, it was occupied, not by pirates… but botanists! A team of botanists on an utterly barren planet. And when I walked up to one, he grabbed me to say that they had been attacked in a nearby cave by the local monsters. But the planet has no monsters, I wanted to tell him. I went to the cave, a two minute walk away, and found their friend about 50 feet in. Sure enough, no monsters to be found, there or anywhere else on the planet. Fast traveled back to the outpost and collected my 4,000 credits.
What I’m trying to say is that if the 950 planets that aren’t part of some main quest chain are going to be filled with this kind of thing, I see little reason to visit. It more or less put me off “exploring” altogether. If you stick to the larger scale scripted quests (these are clearly communicated), and only bother with unique locations (also pretty easy to tell apart) you’ll have a less tedious time of it than I did. There are fun stories to be encountered here and different ways of navigating them, but you have to learn to spot the fool’s gold.

Although Starfield has grown on me as I’ve played it — I’ve put in many hours even as I catalogued its shortcomings — I feel like there’s something missing at the very heart of it. (I thought it was too cruel to title the review “Mass Defect” but I suspect others less kind may take the opportunity.)
And I felt it from the start. The very first mission has you exploring an outpost where scratches on the walls, messy bodies, and various logs describe a project to equip some terrible sharp-clawed creature with a device to make it into a bioweapon. Of course this has gone wrong and everyone’s dead. As you work your way through, the expectation that one of these creatures will appear grows and grows. You emerge onto the roof, an obvious final confrontation point, and are attacked! …By space pirates.
There never was a creature — it was a fake-out, a story about as relevant to your playthrough as any of the Dickens books seemingly everyone in the galaxy is reading (I jettisoned six copies of Hard Times from my ship! I need that inventory space). Or if there is one, it was too valuable a payoff for them to just give you without 10 or 12 more jumps and dialog trees. Most, though not all, of the missions and locations I experienced echoed this in some way, whether they were procedural or crafted. Like a lackluster main course smothered in garnish, all the parsley and croutons are there to disguise the fact that you’re not playing Skyrim in space, you’re playing a decent corridor shooter with extremely laborious level selection.
You want to explore the galaxy, but you can’t, because there is no galaxy, only more menus. What you do encounter, while it’s rendered beautifully a lot of the time, is too often frustratingly banal. You can still have a good time, and I certainly have as I’ve embraced the game for what it is. Many people want to romp through space and blast pirates and robots (and behave more badly than I did, probably) and don’t really care about that absence of wholeness and wonder. But after years of hype and the advances to the genre, I can’t help but feel it falls far short of its own ambition, and likely the expectations of gamers.
There’s also every chance this review will grow irrelevant as the game is improved on, modded, and refined the way Skyrim has been for a decade. Let’s hope Starfield shines brighter in the future.

We’re thrilled to announce that Reed Jobs will join us on September 19 on the Disrupt Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023, which runs from September 19–21 in San Francisco.
Yosemite is a spinoff of Emerson Collective, an impact investing and philanthropic organization formed by Jobs’s mother, Laurene Powell Jobs. Her son spent eight years as its Managing Director of Health before starting his venture firm.
We’re looking forward to learning more about Yosemite — including its atypical strategy that marries a for-profit business with a donor-advised fund to make grant money available to scientists. The VC firm is backed by prominent individuals and institutions, including MIT,  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and John Doerr.
Don’t miss what’s sure to be a fascinating discussion with a rising investor and philanthropist.
Reed Jobs and his team launched Yosemite in August 2023 to make cancer nonlethal in our lifetime. Yosemite works in late-stage academic research and for-profit company creation to invest in the most promising science from across the world to achieve this mission. Jobs holds a BA in history and international security and an MA in history, both from Stanford University.

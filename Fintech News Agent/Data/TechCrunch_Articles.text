Title: Gag City is a viral win for Nicki Minaj
Content: Welcome to Gag City, the pink metropolis inhabited by stans and brands alike.
In the days leading up to the release of “Pink Friday 2,” Nicki Minaj’s fifth studio album and sequel to her debut record “Pink Friday” that dropped on Friday, Twitter was flooded with AI-generated images of pink-toned cityscapes. Gag City, the dreamy false utopia ruled by Minaj and her Barbz, broke through stan Twitter and became a viral meme that brand accounts immediately used for their own marketing — promoting Minaj’s album for free.
Is it an authentic stan-led campaign to build hype for Minaj? Is it a plant to game engagement for both the album and brands? What’s clear is that the viral moment is a win for Minaj, manufactured or not.
It started in September, when Minaj teased the album’s cover art online. The image features Minaj on a pink subway car, drifting through pink clouds with a futuristic (and obviously, pink) city skyline in the background.

She and her Barbz started referring to the album’s release as “Gag City,” NBC News reports, referencing gay slang for being so amazed that you’re at a loss for words. One might be gagged by witnessing a stunning outfit change, or by listening to a perfect record, like “Pink Friday 2.” Leading up to the release, stans started posted AI-generated images of a pink concrete jungle, joking that fictional characters and celebrities were arriving to Gag City in anticipation of Minaj’s album. In one of the first, posted on Dec. 1 according to Know Your Meme, a fan account shared an image of a pink plane labeled “Gagg City” flying over a similarly pink skyline.
In the days before the release, Minaj told fans to “prepare for landing” and teased a description of her pink utopia. Barbz replied with AI-generated renditions of the descent into Gag City.

X (formerly Twitter) users began crafting elaborate narratives about Gag City’s inhabitants and government. One posted an image of Barbz storming the Pink House, which another user described as the fandom’s own January 6th. Another posted an image of pink-clad citizens protesting in the streets of Gag City, calling for Minaj to release the album’s track list. Though some may believe that Gag City is a utopia, one account posted an image of a matronly Minaj handing out CDs of her album to impoverished children “on the outskirts of Gag City,” implying that the pink society also has a class divide problem.
Gag City is also riddled with stan wars, as fans of rival pop stars posted images of their faves vying for Minaj’s seat at the head of her city’s government. In a nod to Greek mythology, one account posted an image of a Trojan horse decorated in Beyoncé’s “Renaissance” disco motif.

Never one to miss out on an easy trend, brand accounts started joining in on the Gag City hype. Chili’s posted an image of rosy smoke billowing from its restaurant, which makes me wonder if air pollution exists in Gag City. Wheat Thins, Baskin-Robbins, Dunkin’ Donuts, Pizza Hut, Red Lobster, Oreo, Bing (??), the Empire State Building and countless others posted their versions of Gag City.

On one hand, memes tend to die the minute brand accounts start co-opting them — nothing is more tiresome than seeing a fun joke turn into a corporate-friendly marketing ploy. AI-generated images are already ethically fraught, and critics have raised concerns over AI generators trained on artwork without the consent of the work’s artists. Artists have also criticized brands for using AI-generated art instead of commissioning work from a real, human artist. Though using AI-generated art for commercial use is legal, as copyright laws pertaining to AI are virtually non-existent, it’s generally seen as a shitty move by many in the art world.
On the other, it’s free promotion for Minaj, and as a lifelong Barb who spent her adolescence running a stan account for “Pink Friday,” I consider it a win.
Nicki Minaj is an artist who’s been embroiled in controversy throughout her career, from posting bad takes about Covid vaccines to defending her husband Kenneth Petty, a convicted sex offender. She may be a brilliant artist, but her problematic history makes her far from the family-friendly public figure that brands are more likely to endorse.
But with Gag City, Minaj has brands doing all of her marketing for her. “Pink Friday 2” is an artistic marvel in itself (though I am probably biased), but the free promotion that it’s been getting as a viral meme is particularly astounding. Artists have spent the last few years trying to drum up engagement for their work by making their songs trend on TikTok, which audiences have started to resist. Gag City doesn’t bank on being the viral song of the summer to drive streaming numbers — the bit is removed enough for non-stans to enjoy it, while still revolving around the album it’s promoting.
Brand Twitter tends to turn fun trends into advertising opportunities, taking organic community interactions and spitting out contrived versions clearly made to go viral. It may be grating, but in this case, it’s working in Minaj’s favor. This week, everyone wants to go to Gag City.

Title: EU lawmakers bag late night deal on ‘global first’ AI rules
Content: After marathon ‘final’ talks which stretched to almost three days European Union lawmakers have tonight clinched a political deal on a risk-based framework for regulating artificial intelligence. The file was originally proposed back in April 2021 but it’s taken months of tricky three-way negotiations to get a deal over the line. The development means a pan-EU AI law is definitively on the way.
Giving a triumphant but exhausted press conference in the small hours of Friday night/Saturday morning local time key representatives for the European Parliament, Council and the Commission — the bloc’s co-legislators — hailed the agreement as hard fought, a milestone achievement and historic, respectively.
Taking to X to tweet the news, the EU’s president, Ursula von der Leyen — who made delivering an AI law a key priority of her term when she took up the post in late 2019 — also lauded the political agreement as a “global first”.
The 🇪🇺 AI Act is a global first. 
A unique legal framework for the development of AI you can trust.
And for the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses.
A commitment we took in our political guidelines – and we delivered.
I welcome today's political agreement.
— Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) December 8, 2023

Full details of what’s been agreed won’t be entirely confirmed until a final text is compiled and made public, which may take some weeks. But a press release put out by the European Parliament confirms the deal reached with the Council includes a total prohibition on the use of AI for:
The use of remote biometric identification technology in public places by law enforcement has not been completely banned — but the parliament said negotiators had agreed on a series of safeguards and narrow exceptions to limit use of technologies such as facial recognition. This includes a requirement for prior judicial authorisation — and with uses limited to a “strictly defined” lists of crime.
Retrospective (non-real-time) use of remote biometric ID AIs will be limited to “the targeted search of a person convicted or suspected of having committed a serious crime”. While real-time use of this intrusive AI tech will be limited in time and location, and can only be used for the following purposes:
The package agreed also includes obligations for AI systems that are classified as “high risk” owing to having “significant potential harm to health, safety, fundamental rights, environment, democracy and the rule of law”.
“MEPs successfully managed to include a mandatory fundamental rights impact assessment, among other requirements, applicable also to the insurance and banking sectors. AI systems used to influence the outcome of elections and voter behaviour, are also classified as high-risk,” the parliament wrote. “Citizens will have a right to launch complaints about AI systems and receive explanations about decisions based on high-risk AI systems that impact their rights.”
There was also agreement on a “two-tier” system of guardrails to be applied to “general” AI systems, such as the so-called foundational models underpinning the viral boom in generative AI applications like ChatGPT.
As we reported earlier the deal reached on foundational models/general purpose AIs (GPAIs) includes some transparency requirements for what co-legislators referred to as “low tier” AIs — meaning model makers must draw up technical documentation and produce (and publish) detailed summaries about the content used for training in order to support compliance with EU copyright law.
The Commission has been working with industry on a stop-gap AI Pact for some months — and it confirmed today this is intended to plug the practice gap until the AI Act comes into force.
While foundational models/GPAIs that have been commercialized face regulation under the Act, R&D is not intended to be in scope of the law — and fully open sourced models will have lighter regulatory requirements than closed source, per today’s pronouncements.
The package agreed also promotes regulatory sandboxes and real-world-testing being established by national authorities to support startups and SMEs to develop and train AIs before placement on the market.
Penalties for non-compliance can lead to fines ranging from €35 million or 7% of global turnover to €7.5 million or 1.5 % of turnover, depending on the infringement and size of the company.
The deal agreed today also allows for a phased entry into force after the law is adopted — with six months allowed until rules on prohibited use cases kick in; 12 months for transparency and governance requirements; and 24 months for all other requirements. So the full force of the EU’s AI Act may not be felt until 2026.
Carme Artigas, Spain’s secretary of state for digital and AI issues, who led the Council’s negotiations on the file as the country has held the rotating Council presidency since the summer, hailed the agreement on the heavily contested file as “the biggest milestone in the history of digital information in Europe”; both for the bloc’s single digital market — but also, she suggested, “for the world”.
“We have achieved the first international regulation for artificial intelligence in the world,” she announced during a post-midnight press conference to confirm the political agreement, adding: “We feel very proud.”
The law will support European developers, startups and future scale-ups by giving them “legal certainty with technical certainty”, she predicted.
Speaking on behalf of the European Parliament, co-rapporteurs Dragoș Tudorache and Brando Benifei said their objective had been to deliver AI legislation that would ensure the ecosystem developed with a “human centric approach” which respects fundamental rights and European values. Their assessment of the outcome was equally upbeat — citing the inclusion in the agreed text of a total ban on the use of AI for predictive policing and for biometric categorization as major wins.
“Finally we got in the right track, defending fundamental rights to the necessity that is there for our democracies to endure such incredible changes,” said Benifei. “We are the first ones in the world to have a horizontal legislation that has this direction on fundamental rights, that supports the development of AI in our continent, and that is up to date to the frontier of the artificial intelligence with the most powerful models under clear obligation. So I think we delivered.”
“We have always been questioned whether there is enough protection, whether there is enough stimulant for innovation in this text, and I can say, this balance is there,” added Tudorache. “We have safeguards, we have all the provisions that we need, the redress that we need in giving trust to our citizens in the interaction with AI, in the products in the services that they will interact with from now on.
“We now have to use this blueprint to seek now global convergence because this is a global challenge for everyone. And I think that with the work that we’ve done, as difficult as it was — and it was difficult, this was a marathon negotiation by all standards, looking at all precedents so far — but I think we delivered.”
The EU’s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, also chipped in with his two euro-cents — describing the agreement clinched a little before midnight Brussels’ time as “historic”. “It is a full package. It is a complete deal. And this is why we spent so much time,” he intoned. “This is balancing user safety, innovation for startups, while also respecting… our fundamental rights and our European values.”
Despite the EU very visibly patting itself on the back tonight on securing a deal on ‘world-first’ AI rules, it’s not quite yet the end of the road for the bloc’s lawmaking process as there are still some formal steps to go — not least the final text will face votes in the parliament and the Council to adopt it. But given how much division and disagreement there has been over how (or even whether) to regulate AI the biggest obstacles have been dismantled with this political deal and the path to passing the EU AI Act in the coming months looks clear.
The Commission is certainly projecting confidence. Per Breton, work to implement the agreement starts immediately with the set up of an AI Office within the EU’s executive — which will have the job of coordinating with the Member State oversight bodies that will need to enforce the rules on AI firms. “We will welcome new colleagues… a lot of them,” he said. “We will work — starting tomorrow — to get ready.”
EU ‘final’ talks to fix AI rules to run into second day — but deal on foundational models is on the table

Title: Report: FAA should improve investigation process after a rocket launch goes awry
Content: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has let launch providers conduct their own investigations in nearly every instance that a launch mishap has occurred since the start of the century — a practice that needs closer scrutiny, a federal watchdog said in a new report.
The report, published Thursday by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), takes a close look at the investigations into launch mishaps, the industry term for when a launch ends in an explosion or other failure. Mishap investigations are a normal course of action and are generally under the aegis of the FAA — but this report reveals that the practice is basically entirely operator-led, with the FAA having inadequate resources for in-house investigations.
Of the 49 mishaps that occurred between 2000 and 2023, and for which FAA was the lead investigative authority, all were led by the launch operator, the report found. The one exception was an investigation into a fatal accident involving SpaceShipTwo in October 2014, for which the National Transportation Safety Board was the lead authority.
The FAA lets the launch company lead its own investigations for a number of reasons, officials told GAO. A close understanding of vehicle design and the underlying technology is necessary when undertaking a root cause investigation into a failure, and the operators know their vehicle best. FAA officials also estimated that in-house investigations would take 10-20 times longer than those led by the operator.
The U.S. Government Accountability Office said the FAA should develop criteria for determining when a mishap investigation is led by its office or the launch provider, the report said. It further found that the FAA has not evaluated the effectiveness of its “operator-reliant” mishap investigation process.
“FAA officials told us they make their decisions to authorize operator-led investigations depending on the level of investigation required, which is largely based on severity of the mishap or its consequences and may also take into consideration the level of public interest,” the report said. “However, in practice, FAA authorized the operator involved to lead the investigation of its mishap for all 49 mishaps for which FAA had lead investigative authority.”
Even when investigations are led by the launch company, the FAA still exercises some degree of oversight and involvement in the process. But some stakeholders questioned whether the launch companies “can be impartial or effective investigators of their own mishaps.”
Launch providers told the GAO that they take steps to maintain independence of their internal investigations, and others said that market incentives and insurance requirements can also create positive incentives for a rigorous, credible investigation process.
Regardless, GAO found that the FAA did not maintain criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of operator-led investigations, and has no formal channels for operators to share their findings with the wider industry.
“Without a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of its operator-led mishap investigation process, FAA cannot be assured that its safety oversight is best achieving agency objectives in an area of critical importance,” GAO said.

Title: Apple cuts off Beeper Mini’s access after launch of service that brought iMessage to Android
Content: Was it too good to be true? Beeper, the startup that reverse-engineered iMessage to bring blue bubble texts to Android users, is experiencing an outage, the company reported via a post on X on Friday. And Apple is to blame, it seems. Users, including those of us at TechCrunch with access to the app, began seeing error messages when trying to send texts via the newly released Beeper Mini and messages are not going through.
The error message reads: “failed to lookup on server: lookup request timed out” spelled out in red letters.

In a response to a question on Reddit as to whether or not the app was broken, a Beeper team member had earlier replied, “Report a problem from the app, give us a chance to look into it.”
However, Beeper CEO Eric Migicovsky responded to TechCrunch’s inquiry about Beeper Mini’s status by pointing us to the X post acknowledging the outage, and providing more detail. Asked if possibly Apple found a way to cut off Beeper Mini’s ability to function, he replied, “Yes, all data indicates that.”
Investigating reports that sending/receiving is not working in Beeper Mini 🔎
— Beeper (@onbeeper) December 8, 2023

We don’t know what this means for the future of Beeper Mini’s efforts, unless Beeper’s engineers are able to work around the problem somehow.
Migicovsky, who previously founded the smartwatch Pebble, has argued that Beeper Mini wasn’t just beneficial for Android users who wanted to finally join their iMessage friends’ group chats, but that it increased security for iPhone users, too.
In an interview ahead of Beeper Mini’s launch, the founder explained that green bubble texts were unencrypted.
“That means that anytime you text your Android friends, anyone can read the message. Apple can read the message. Your phone carrier can read the message. Google… literally, it’s just like a postcard. Anyone can read it. So Beeper Mini actually increases the security of iPhones,” he had told TechCrunch.
Apple, on the other hand, sees iMessage as one of the key tools for locking in users to its ecosystem, which is why it won’t launch an iMessage app for Android. While there was some hope that EU regulations would force it to make iMessage more interoperable, news this week indicates that iMessage will get a reprieve from those rules because the service is not popular enough with business users. That means Apple has no reason not to try to shut down Beeper Mini, if it could.
Migicovsky is none too pleased with that turn of events.
“I would be very interested to hear why they think that making security worse for iPhone users makes sense,” he said.
“If it’s Apple, then I think the biggest question is — if Apple truly cares about the privacy and security of their own iPhone users, why would they try to kill a service that enables iPhones to send encrypted chats to Android users? With their announcement of RCS support, it’s clear that Apple knows they have a gaping hole here. Beeper Mini is here today and works great. Why force iPhone users back to sending unencrypted SMS when they chat with friends on Android?,” he asked.
Founded in 2020, Beeper’s team had originally been working on a multi-platform messaging aggregator, which was renamed Beeper Cloud this week as Beeper Mini went to launch. The latter uses new technology that allows Android users to text iMessage users as if they were also texting from an iPhone for just $1.99 per month. That means blue bubbles in the group chat, not green ones. Because the startup was no longer using a middleman — like a Mac server relaying messages, as other iMessage-to-Android apps employ — it would essentially appear to Apple’s servers that Beeper Mini’s messages were coming from a device that runs iMessage natively. It’s unclear, then, how Apple was able to cut off Beeper Mini’s access.
What this means for Beeper Mini’s future is uncertain.
“We’ll evaluate options,” Migicovsky said.
Update, maybe?

Title: Will December bring startup winter?
Content: Welcome to Startups Weekly. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.
Borrowing has become more expensive, and profits are harder to come by, which means that 2023 has been a savage year in startup land. PitchBook data suggests that around 3,200 startups — representing a total of $27.2 billion in venture funding — have gone under, with a significant number of startups being in zombie mode: Unable to grow, unable to raise money, but just about limping by well enough to avoid shutdown. Layoffs are happening — also in December — and over the next couple of weeks, a bunch more startups will shut down, so as to not drag out the inevitable into a new tax year. I’ll be looking into this more deeply over the next couple of weeks, so stay tuned.
Also: I was supposed to be writing this newsletter but instead ended up playing the TechCrunch pub quiz for way too long. My score was . . . embarrassingly poor, considering that I’ve literally read every story on the site for the past year to write this newsletter. Still, it was fun — give it a whirl!

I love it when my colleagues are going super deep into nerd land. That’s definitely one of the hallmarks of Devin’s work from time to time; in this case, he talks about how “Star Trek: Deep Space Nine” fans are using AI to make the old show look better because there’s no official high-quality version. They’re using AI to add details to the original episodes, which is tough and takes a lot of effort — but it’s showing a bunch of promise. Devin concludes that the tech could be a cool way for companies to upgrade old shows, but there are some legal and technical hurdles to figure out. Don’t miss his 3,000-word ode to de-grainification.
The other AI-related nerd-out this week comes courtesy of Ron, who dug into the continued relevance of traditional AI models in enterprises, despite the rise of large language models (LLMs). That makes sense: LLMs are kind of the Leatherman of AI tools: They sort of do everything. I never leave the house without my Leatherman, and it has helped me out of many a knotty situation, but if I’m building a house or repairing a car, I break out the more specialized tool kit.
More startuppy AI news this week:
This really moved me: Just when you thought your online photos were safe, here comes Animate Anyone turning them into eerily lifelike, video deepfakes — because regular old photo fakes weren’t unsettling enough.
G-oops-le: Google’s new AI model Gemini isn’t exactly hitting it out of the park, with early users finding more bloopers than brilliance in its answers. Turns out, even Google can have an “oops” moment in the AI world.
The Pokémon approach to startups: Elon Musk, seemingly never tired of starting new ventures, is now chasing a cool $1 billion for his latest AI escapade — xAI — because why settle for running just a few companies when you can add another AI startup to your collection?

Look, I’m as bored of Elon Musk as everyone else, but gotta give the guy credit for one thing: He doesn’t half attract some attention. Rarely for good reasons, recently, it must be said.
Darrell summarizes the situation in his piece “The end of Elon,” where he — tongue firmly planted in cheek and with the snark meter turned to 11 — dissects the Tesla Cybertruck launch (spoiler: It was a bit of a nothingburger; there’s still much unknown about the truck) and Musk’s, er, unique approach to managing his various ventures — including telling X (formerly Twitter) advertisers to go do something anatomically improbable.
Of course, there was (much) more Musk-related news this week, and if you want it all, give our Elon Musk tag a quick scroll.
What goes up . . . :  SpaceX drops $2.2 million on a parachute company, because apparently making parachutes that don’t buckle in space is harder than rocket science.
Keep on truckin’: The Tesla Cyberbeast: Heavy, quick, and falling a bit short in towing compared to its high-priced electric rivals — but hey, who’s counting when you’re driving an angular beast?
Show me the money:  X has scored licenses for payment processing in 12 U.S. states, inching closer to Musk’s vision of turning the platform into an “everything app.” With recent advertiser exits and controversies, it seems there’s more drama than dollars in Musk’s grand plan — for now.

After the heyday of 2021, a bunch of startups are crashing to the ground after failing to meet their goals. Let’s have a moment of silence for some of our fallen-from-grace brethren:
To its final zesting place: Going from a zesty $450 million valuation to shutting down, even Goldman Sachs’ backing couldn’t spice up ZestMoney’s survival.
So close: Edtech company Doubtnut learns the hard way that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, selling for $10 million after passing up a $150 million deal from Byju’s.
Now, not so fab: From unicorn to extinct: Prefab home builder Veev proves that soaring to billion-dollar status doesn’t guarantee a sturdy foundation.
That not enough for ya? Fine, here’s a collection of the most-loved, most-read articles from the past week:
Is it a bird? Is it a plane?: Anduril’s new fighter jet weapon, Roadrunner, lands with the grace of a Falcon 9.
Pour me another one: MIT spinoff Liquid AI thinks it’s time for a change in the AI game with their new “liquid neural network,” because who needs another GPT clone when you can have AI inspired by worm brains and run on a Raspberry Pi . . .
Yeah, but will it wear a beanie hat?: Ex-SpaceX engineers are now saving the planet with a “vegetarian rocket engine,” because apparently shooting stuff into space wasn’t cool enough. Also, were previous rockets full of bacon? I’m confused.
It’s electrifying: GM and Toyota, welcome to the Oops, We Missed the EV Bus club!
Breaking kneecaps, and YouTube records: Grand Theft Auto VI just stole MrBeast’s YouTube crown, racking up more views in a day than a money-giving philanthropist could dream of.

Title: Travelsist hopes its air travel concierge will take off from Atlanta
Content: If you are dreading to catch flights over the holiday season, you are not alone. Forget about marveling at the wonder that is flying; going through an airport is still very much a hassle, and this is where Atlanta-based startup Travelsist can help.
There are several sides to what the company does, including an AI-enabled chatbot called VERA. But “at the simplest level,” its team told me, “the Travelsist platform connects travelers who need help getting through the airport with a Travelsistant who provides concierge and personal assistant services that help get them from their ride to plane-side safely and on time.”
Founded by former flight attendant Veronica Woodruff, the startup was a Startup Battlefield company at TechCrunch Disrupt earlier this year. At the time, I highlighted how it was part of a growing group of startups that make life easier for disabled individuals; but there are many more people that Travelsist can help, including working moms like Woodruff.
“I arrived at the airport one day for a cross-country flight, and realized I’d left my daughter’s stroller at home,” she recalled.
From parents to seniors to first-time fliers, there are many who could use a hand, and there is more than wheelchair or stroller services that can make airports more accessible; which is why Travelsist also provides passengers “help with wayfinding, or other physical or navigational support in what is oftentimes a very stressful and chaotic portion of their trip.”
While Travelsist’s end users are the passengers, the startup’s customers are airports and airlines (except for a few exceptions where passengers can request assistance and pay for it themselves).
Going B2B2C make sense: These have a legal obligation to assist people with disabilities, for instance, but it often proves expensive and tricky, which is why they are willing to outsource it to a third party like Travelsist.
Travelsist doesn’t simply find people who can provide assistance; it also leverages technology to make the whole process more efficient. For instance, the platform reduces waiting time for assistance by locating where it is required, Woodruff told me.
While the company received international interest, the U.S. was its initial focus, starting with Atlanta — and not just Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL). Travelsist is now able to assist passengers flying in and out of the two biggest airports in its hometown. Since Disrupt, it closed a partnership with DeKalb-Peachtree Airport (PDK), which Woodruff described to me as “a popular regional Atlanta-area airport that services lots of private flights and VIP travelers.”
It is a natural evolution for Travelsist to expand its audience, and it already has. Since its inception four years ago and subsequent launch in 2020, the company wrote in a document which head of product Dino Decespedes shared with me, “Travelsist’s value proposition has evolved from babygear rental for moms who travel, to an enterprise software solution solving human capital headaches for the world’s busiest airports and airliners.”
Talking to Woodruff in person, the human element mentioned above comes across much more clearly, and it becomes clear how she is passionate not only about helping travelers, but also providing Travelsistants with fulfilling and potentially life-changing work opportunities.
“What I love most about being able to offer people the opportunity to work at a company that’s at the airport is that they have an opportunity to meet someone that’s beyond their front door. There’s so many people that come from so many different walks of life, that you never know how a 10-minute conversation can influence or change your life; that person can be someone that can offer you an even better job than Travelsist,” Woodruff said.
In the meantime, Travelsist is intentional about making sure that these 1099 workers “know that they’re valued and that they’re appreciated,” and enjoy good working conditions. “We pride ourselves in being a tech company first, but the number one thing is that we’re bringing in a new culture to this industry, where people can have more control over their time, earn good wages and be trained with [new] skills.”
Travelsist’s employee app is there to support these workers by filling them in with specific details around a traveler’s request and location, but also providing them with training and reminders. For example, making sure a passenger is properly buckled up before you lift them, and asking nicely for permission — a welcome change, considering that flying with a disability too often ends up being dehumanizing.
If the company ever runs out of Travelsistants, it can count on My PANDA, a fellow Atlanta-based startup (PANDA stands for Personal Assistants Next Door). It’s run by a really good friend of hers, Woodruff said. “We have an agreement where I can dip into her staff: If I need them, they come and work for us. Atlanta is a beautiful place to build because of those relationships.”
Atlanta investors are bullish on where the city’s startup scene is headed

Besides its core team and its Travelsistants, Travelsist also has some 25 contractors and “a lot of people who advise us and meet with us.” The company was part of the first women-focused cohort of the Techstars Founder Catalyst Program based in Atlanta and conducted in partnership with J.P. Morgan; it also received support and awards from several other organizations. This is part of being from Atlanta, Woodruff beamed. “Atlanta is a very hands-on city when you’re building something that people believe in; people want us to succeed.”
Beyond Atlanta, the company was flying relatively under the radar until recently, when it obtained some provisional patents that made the team more confident about its odds against competitors.
AI is part of its strategy: At TechCrunch Disrupt, it launched VERA, a chatbot that can answer traveler questions “around flight times, airport shops and restaurants, security line wait times, parking instructions, airport and TSA rules, hours of operation, and much much more,” the team wrote to me.

For airports and airlines, the chatbot is another opportunity to improve traveler satisfaction, which they can track alongside other metrics in the customized data dashboard that Travelsist provides.
This value proposition seems to be resonating. “We are on track to close 12-15 new airports in the first half of 2024, which would allow us to service more travelers end-to-end — in their departure airport AND their arrival airport,” Woodruff messaged me.
Travelsist already has some raised some $850,000 funding to execute its plans, including investment from The Fearless Fund and a grant from the Black ParentPreneur Foundation. But it is understandably seeking more, and currently is raising a $5 million Series A round it hopes to close by the end of the year. This would be timely, as travel woes will be on many minds at this time of the year.

Title: DNA companies should receive the death penalty for getting hacked
Content: Personal data is the new gold. The recent 23andMe data breach is a stark reminder of a chilling reality — our most intimate, personal information might not be as secure as we think. It’s a damning indictment of the sheer negligence of companies that, while profiting from our DNA, are failing to protect it.
The 23andMe breach saw hackers gaining access to a whopping 6.9 million users’ personal information, including family trees, birth years and geographic locations. It brings to the fore a few significant questions: Are companies really doing enough to protect our data? Should we trust them with our most intimate information?
23andMe confirms hackers stole ancestry data on 6.9 million users

Companies are promising to keep our data safe, but there are a couple of quirks here. Government overreach is certainly a possibility, as the FBI and every policing agency in the world is probably salivating at the thought of getting access to such a huge dataset of DNA sequences. It could be a gold mine for every cold case from here to the South Pole.
The argument, “But if you haven’t done something wrong, you have nothing to worry about!” is only partially applicable, here: The problem is one of consent. My father at one point did a DNA test, and discovered he had a half-brother who is about to turn 80. Cue an incredible amount of family drama when they started digging into the history and unearthed a whole bunch of potentially problematic family history.
The problem isn’t so much that my dad chose to do that, it is that I didn’t consent to being in a database, and that’s where things get sticky. I can envision a definite Black Mirror-esque future, where one family member is curious about their ancestry, gets tested, and two weeks later, the FBI comes knocking on every person’s door who shares 50% DNA with that person because they are wanted for some sort of crime.
The audacity of 23andMe, and companies like it, is astounding. They pitch themselves as guardians of our genetic history, as the gatekeepers of our ancestral pasts and potential medical futures. But when the chips are down and our data is leaked, they hide behind the old “we were not hacked; it was the users’ old passwords” excuse.
This logic is equivalent to a bank saying, “It’s not our fault your money got stolen; you should have had a better lock on your front door.” It’s unacceptable and a gross abdication of responsibility.
Companies that deal with such sensitive data should be held to the highest possible standard. We’re not just talking about credit card numbers or email addresses here. This is our DNA, the very blueprint of our existence. If anything should be considered “sacred” in the digital realm, surely it should be this?
The fact that the stolen data was advertised as a list of people with ancestries that have, in the past, been victims of systemic discrimination, adds another disturbing layer to this debacle. It highlights the potential for such data to be misused in the most nefarious ways, including targeted attacks and discrimination.
23andMe says hackers accessed ‘significant number’ of files about users’ ancestry

The DNA testing industry needs to step up. It must ensure that the security measures in place are not just adequate, but exceptional. They should be leading the charge in cybersecurity, setting an example for all other industries to follow.
This is not just about better passwords or two-factor authentication. This is about a fundamental shift in how these companies view the data they are entrusted with. It’s about recognizing the profound responsibility they have, not just to their customers, but to society at large.
Am I hopeful? Not even a little. I’ve long argued that after the Equifax breach, the company should have received the corporate equivalent of the death penalty. Instead, it was given a $700 million fine. I think that’s laughable. Allowing a breach of such a magnitude to even be possible, never mind actually come to pass? You don’t deserve to continue to be a company. I think that is even truer for companies dealing with our DNA.
It’s time for 23andMe and the DNA testing industry as a whole to realize that they are not just dealing with data. They are dealing with people’s lives, their histories and their futures. It’s time they started treating our data with the respect and care it deserves.

Title: Fundraising trends for 2024: Get to the point, explain ‘why now’
Content: 
Thanksgiving is long behind us, so unless you’re already in due diligence with a VC, you may as well pack up your fundraising knapsack and chill out until the holidays are over.
But this is an opportunity, too. The quiet weeks ahead are the perfect time to polish your pitch deck and perfect your pitch before kicking things back off in January.
According to a new report on the early-stage fundraising trends of 2023 by DocSend, things are pretty bleak for young startups. At the seed stage, founders have had to contact more investors but ended up with fewer meetings, pointing to an increasingly competitive fundraising environment.
The report shows a correlation between the number of investors contacted and both the number of meetings held and the amount of funding raised. Many seed-stage startups in the dataset managed to secure a significant number of meetings, and consequently, raised capital, by reaching out to fewer than 50 investors. In contrast, founders who contacted more than 80 investors were a lot less successful.
There may be some noise in the data, however: AI’s popularity and availability has made it easier for founders to reach out to a lot of VCs (anecdotally, that seems to be what the VCs are observing as well). The best advice? Make sure you know how VC works and what an investment thesis is.

Title: Mulch and the enduring appeal of internet absurdism
Content: I am haunted by mulch posts. 
The most recent mulch video came to me in the middle of the night, when I was hours into scrolling through a particularly nasty bout of insomnia. The video was an edit of a tiny dog surrounded by a frame of glittering hearts, with an AI-generated voice narrating, “Today, I soilmaxxed to the highest potential. I am full of loam, asbestos and red 40.”
Enjoy your day my Mulch pups🪴🪴🪴⛽️🛢️🍂🪷🤎🏜️ #mulch #loam #mulchmaxxing #sisteroftheloam #mulching #ilovemulch #fyp 
 ♬ original sound – Sisters of the Loam🪴🤎 
 
Mulch posts have periodically appeared in my restless nights for months. In the hours that I know I should be sleeping, I am hounded by content of petite dogs proclaiming that they’re soilpilled, or mulchmaxxing, or delighting in eating mulch with fellow sisters of the loam. The mulchgang prays for a plentiful harvest. Mulch posts celebrate a body nourished by microplastics and synthetic food dye. The silty clay earth feeds us all. 
Before the inevitable moral panic sets in once the trend gains enough mainstream attention: Mulch posts are not encouraging children to ingest dirt. Mulch memes are just that — silly posts that, like the absurd, post-ironic internet humor that has been popular for years, aren’t that deep. The trend’s earnestness provides a brief reprieve from the fatalist cynicism that tends to drive meme culture. 
The meme came from, of all places, Instagram Reels. The spread of mulch posts across TikTok shows that Instagram still has influence in driving internet culture, despite Reels’ rocky start. It’s one of the first original Reels content to go viral beyond Instagram.   
Mulchposting started with a post in May from Instagram meme account sme11a__, which featured the word “mulch” superimposed on a low-res image of a white dog. The post was captioned, “mulch is here #mulchgang.” The post itself wasn’t particularly viral; in the last six months, it’s gained about 10,000 likes. The meme didn’t go viral until sme11a__ posted a Reel referencing the meme a month later, Know Your Meme reports, which gained over 103,000 likes. Other meme accounts started posting similar content — in a post of a comically fluffy dog with the text “sandy clay loam,” the meme account qooslag even credited sme11a__ for starting the trend.

Sme11a__, whose Instagram bio says they don’t have a TikTok account, continued posting mulch Reels throughout the summer. The videos typically featured supercuts of fluffy white dogs over audio about mulch. In September, they posted a Reel using an AI-generated childish voice that said, “I love mulch. Mulch is my favorite food.”
Others started reposting sme11a__’s Reel, which had over 195,000 likes on Instagram, to TikTok that month. The meme, which had been largely contained to Instagram, began taking off on the competing platform. On TikTok, the tag #mulchgang has over 49 million views, and tag #mulchmaxxing has over 20 million views. TikToks about the meme’s apparent obscurity and bizarre premise further propelled its popularity. 
Under a video about struggling to explain the meme to those who aren’t chronically online, TikTok user bisouchuu commented, “i am mulchmaxxing on microplastic 24/7 but i keep mentioning it to my non soilpilled friends.” 
“This message makes me feel like a Victorian child when I read it,” another user replied to bisouchuu. 
RIP to my fellow members of #mulchgang lmao #mulch #mulchgangforlife #mulchfairy #fyp

Some have questioned whether mulch posts could be dogwhistles for hate groups. It’s understandable that viewers would be suspicious of coded language in memes, given the history of white supremacy groups adopting seemingly innocuous imagery as symbols of their ideology. The white nationalist campaign to claim Pepe the Frog as the face of racist extremism jaded us all against anything online that should be wholesome. An Instagram user asked sme11a__ to reassure them that mulch gang isn’t a “n@z1” or “NFT cult” in the comments of a recent Reel.
“im not any of those things, mulch gang is just funny dogs eat dirt,” sme11a__ replied.
Mulchposting has all the markers of meme humor mischaracterized as “Gen Z culture,” which is really just Very Online humor. It’s absurd, and it’s easy to replicate, and there’s space for the joke to evolve. Internet absurdism is cyclical in nature, and mulch posts have been preceded by years of shitposting.
In 2017, The Washington Post tried to explain internet humor in a column titled, “Why is millennial humor so weird?” The column cited the meme “Hey Beter,” a four-panel image that starts with someone addressing the “Family Guy” character Peter Griffin as “Beter,” and ends with a phrase completely unrelated to the first image. In the example cited by The Washington Post, a laser-eyed Elmo holds Peter at gunpoint and demands that he spell “Whomst’ve.” The meme ends by asking viewers to “follow for a free iphone 5.”  
In its recent explanation of Gen Z humor for bewildered millennials, Insider cited the Grimace shake trend that went viral on TikTok earlier this year. In Grimace shake videos, TikTok users filmed themselves taking sips of McDonald’s purple milkshake, before the video abruptly cut to a clip of the same user incapacitated on the ground, in abandoned buildings or in eerily empty playgrounds. 
Neither “Hey Beter” nor the Grimace shake trend have an explicit punchline. The non sequitur is the punchline. Absurdist philosophy pervades meme humor, and the futility of trying to explain jokes that are ultimately meaningless is what makes internet absurdism so funny. It’s fitting that the meme “One Must Imagine Sisyphus Happy,” which went viral on Instagram and TikTok this year when users paired the phrase with images and videos of impossible tasks, is pulled from an essay by philosopher and absurdist writer Albert Camus.
“one imagine sisyphus is happy” #jpegmafia #the_bitter_sweet_deluxe #fart #groundgeef #kanyewest

Internet culture is constantly subverting itself, and the “Gen Z humor” shaping memes today, like mulch posts, is an evolution of “millennial humor” of the 2010s. With its motivational undertones and earnest nature, the version of internet humor that exists today is decidedly less bleak than its millennial predecessor, which the Guardian described as “disorientating, dark and strange” in 2019. That millennial humor was shaped by online trends that existed long before social media. The 1998 “Hampster Dance,” credited as one of the first internet memes, was infectious, nonsensical and at the time, inexplicably funny.
The trajectory of mulch posts, from Instagram to TikTok instead of the other way around, is uncommon, but given the enduring popularity of absurdist memes, it makes sense that shitpost-y content would be one of the first original Instagram trends to break through to mainstream social media in years. Screenshots of Instagram posts, most of which are from meme accounts, are constantly reposted as TikTok slideshows — though the recycled content consists of standalone memes, and haven’t inspired a larger trend under a unifying theme. Reels may have had original trends, like viral songs or popular editing techniques, but few, if any, have been unique enough to spread to other platforms. 
Instagram’s hold on internet culture slipped as TikTok usage became more ubiquitous in recent years, and TikTok users have derided Instagram users as millennials who are behind on meme trends. Instagram’s short-form video feature, Reels, was built to rival TikTok, but the platform’s early years have been dominated by recycled TikToks. Instagram has tried to discourage users from reposting TikToks by refusing to recommend posts that contain TikTok’s watermark. An internal Meta document from August 2022 noted that nearly a third of Reels content was originally posted elsewhere, The Wall Street Journal reported. 
Lacking original content and overrun with reposts, Reels has been perceived as a platform for out-of-touch millennials — a sentiment jokingly held by many on TikTok. More Gen Z adults use Instagram than TikTok, according to surveys conducted by the data analysis company Morning Consult for its semiannual report on media and entertainment, and more Gen Z adults use both platforms at least once a day than millennials. It isn’t a generational divide that’s fueling the negative perception of Reels, it’s the lack of original content. 
TikTok users often joke that Reels users are slow to adopt trends and behind on current events. One recent viral video about Reels users, posted in November, says, “instagram reels users just finding out that the submarine imploded,” referencing OceanGate’s Titan submersible that went missing and later found wrecked in June. 
Mulch is one of the first Reels trends that actually originated on Instagram, and it’s one of the first to translate to other social media platforms’ formats. The meme can exist as a static image of a crusty white dog asking, “who up mulching?” or as a video narrated by an AI-generated voice extolling the virtues of munching on chemically enriched soil. 
In 2021, i-D predicted that incomprehensible shitposting accounts would prevail over the polished meme accounts that post content for universal appeal. Today, Instagram’s meme culture has largely shifted toward low-effort, text-heavy content that blends confessional captions with seemingly unrelated imagery. A recent post from the Instagram account fembiotic, for example, superimposed the text “my life is over. (my birthday is coming up)” over a vintage illustration of a cat holding a pink cupcake.  

A post shared by magical girl (@fembiotic)

Meme accounts are keeping Instagram relevant in the face of competitors, and naturally, a meme account drove one of the first original Reels trends. 
Whether the meme lasts is questionable — nothing kills a meme faster than going mainstream enough to be co-opted by brands, or worse, being covered by a news outlet — but the internet absurdism that shapes mulch posts will continue evolving into something weirder and more unexplainable long after mulch loses relevance. By then, it won’t be “Gen Alpha humor” or whatever generation comes after. It’ll still be internet absurdism. Until then, Reels can shake its profoundly uncool reputation by leaning into the shitposting. The sisters of the loam are all for it.

Funding for AI-related startups surpassed $68.7 billion in 2023, but “mega-deals” might be inflating those numbers. In Q3, total VC funding in the space was around $22.1 billion. But after subtracting Big Tech’s mega-deals, the total is more like $15.1 billion. As Kyle Wiggers writes, “Could it be that VCs, initially swept up by the generative AI hype, are coming down to earth and/or growing wary of the tech’s risks?”

Twilio’s share price is down after it laid off staff this week amid great instability. In February, CEO Jeff Lawson announced that he’s splitting the business into two parts, with Elena Donio tapped to head data and apps. During its Q3 earnings call, however, the company announced that Donio would be stepping down. And that’s not even taking into account its tanking stock price.
Twilio might actually deserve activist investor attention

Dear Sophie,
I’m currently in the U.S. working for my employer on an H-1B. I’ve been wanting to start my own company, but I’ve been working on boosting my accomplishments for the O-1A because I’ve read in your past columns over the years that transferring an H-1B to a startup comes with a lot of downsides for startup founders, including giving up control and equity. How has that now changed?
— Future Founder
Ask Sophie: Does the H-1B visa require founders to give up equity and control?

Title: OpenAI taps former Twitter India head to kickstart in the country
Content: OpenAI is working with former Twitter India head Rishi Jaitly as a senior advisor to facilitate talks with the government about AI policy, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. OpenAI is also looking to set up a local team in India.
People familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that Jaitly has been helping OpenAI navigate the Indian policy and regulatory landscape.
OpenAI currently does not have an official presence in India (apart from a trademark, approved earlier this month). However, OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman visited New Delhi during his world tour in June and met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. After his meeting, Altman said he had a great conversation with Modi. Nevertheless, neither Altman nor the company made any announcements during his two-day visit.
It’s not clear if Jaitly is formally employed at OpenAI, but he’s been taking on a role advising the company on how to establish connections in India. He started in the role sometime after Altman’s New Delhi visit, two sources told TechCrunch.
Between 2007 and 2009, Jaitly served as head of the public-private partnership for Google in India before moving to Twitter (now called X) in 2012. He was the company’s first employee in the country, according to his LinkedIn profile.
He was later elevated to VP for the APAC and MENA region. In late 2016, Jaitly left Twitter and became the co-founder and CEO of Times Bridge, the global investment arm of the Indian media giant The Times Group. Times Bridge’s portfolio includes Uber, Airbnb, Coursera, Mubi, Smule and Wattpad. Jaitly left the firm in 2022.
OpenAI and Jaitly did not respond to requests for comment.
OpenAI’s vice president of global affairs, Anna Makanju, is scheduled to speak at the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence summit in Delhi next week, alongside other industry experts and international politicians. She will be a part of the session titled “Collaborative AI for Global Partnership (CAIGP) – Global Cooperation for Equitable AI.” Sources told TechCrunch that Jaitly assisted in setting up Makanju’s participation at the event.

In recent weeks, OpenAI’s leadership has been on a roller coaster. First, Altman and board president Greg Brockman were abruptly ousted from the company. The duo joined Microsoft for a hot minute before returning to OpenAI with a revamped board.
At an event hosted by Times Group in New Delhi during his June visit, Altman responded to a question about building foundational models with a $10 million budget. It’s “hopeless,” he said. (OpenAI has raised a bit more itself — over $11 billion to date — to build its foundational models.)
His comments met some backlash from Indian entrepreneurs, but Altman clarified later that his words were taken out of context and that he meant it’s hard to compete with the likes of OpenAI with such a budget.
“The right question is what a startup can do that’s never been done before, that will contribute a new thing to the world. I have no doubt Indian startups can and will do that,” he said in a post on X.
this is really taken out of context! the question was about competing with us with $10 million, which i really do think is not going to work. but i still said try! however, i think it’s the wrong question.
— Sam Altman (@sama) June 10, 2023

Critics have described India as severely lagging behind in the world of AI development, not least because of the lack of funding. This piece in September noted that India’s AI startups have raised around $4 billion, which sounds like a big number until you consider the $50 billion that has been poured into the ecosystem in India’s great rival, China; or the $11 billion+ that OpenAI alone has raised (along with the billions more picked up by other large players, and of course the money Big Tech is putting into this).
A more sympathetic viewpoint might be that India’s AI development is still just nascent, with a few startups such as Sarvam — which recently raised $41 million from investors including Lightspeed, Peak XV, and Khosla Ventures — just getting started on building foundational models.
“While there are over 1,500 AI-based startups in India with over $4 billion of funding, India is still losing the AI innovation battle,” analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein said in a note.
That leaves a big gap for companies like OpenAI. India, the world’s most populous country and the second-biggest internet market after China, with over 880 million users, presents an opportunity for growth. Altman hinted at the company’s interest in the country during his June visit to the engineering college IIIT Delhi.
“It really is amazing to watch what’s happening in India with the embrace of AI — not just OpenAI but other technologies, too,” he said at the time.
That said, the company has yet to disclose any investment in the country (save for the trademark).
And it might not be a fast move. An OpenAI investor told TechCrunch that the company does consider India its key market and is looking to explore opportunities to grow its presence.
But with OpenAI’s leadership locked in, now with a more aligned board behind its bolder commercial push, regulation is really one of the last things in the company’s way. And so working on the regulatory front may be the first and most important efforts it can be making right now.
For now the task may be more about understanding what direction things will be moving in coming years.
Indian government officials have indicated multiple times this year that they are not looking to put strict regulations around AI development. India’s IT Minister of State Rajeev Chandrasekhar has repeatedly pushed for international collaboration to develop a framework on regulating AI, with the “guardrails of safety and trust.”
“We are very committed to AI,” he said at the Global Technology Summit in New Delhi earlier this week, hosted by Carnegie India and India’s external affairs ministry. “We certainly are focused on using AI in real-life use cases and our prime minister is absolutely a believer that technology can transform the lives of people, make governments deliver more, deliver faster, deliver better. And so AI is going to be for us used to build models and build capabilities that are aimed at real-life use cases.”
Unlike OpenAI, its biggest investor and strategic partner Microsoft — which now has an observer seat on the board — has a strong hold in India. The software behemoth, which established its local presence in the Indian market back in 1990, has one of its largest R&D centers outside its Redmond headquarters in Bengaluru and three data centers across the country. It has over 20,000 employees across 10 Indian cities. The company is also an active investor in Indian startups.
We have contacted OpenAI for comment and will update this post when and if it responds.

Title: Google’s AI-assisted NotebookLM note-taking app is now open to users in the US
Content: Google’s AI note-taking app is now available to all users in the United States who are at least 18 years old, the company announced on Friday. The experimental app is also getting a slew of new features and starting to use Gemini Pro, Google’s new large language model, to “help with document understanding and reasoning.”
Once you upload documents to NotebookLM, the app can automatically generate summaries and suggest follow-up questions about the content in the documents. Unlike generic chatbots that draw on large amounts of unrelated information, NotebookLM solely focuses on the documents that it is fed.
Now, Google is adding new capabilities to the product to go beyond generating summaries and suggesting questions.
NotebookLM now has new tools designed to help users organize their curated notes into structured writing projects. For instance, you can select a set of notes and ask NotebookLM to create something new, such as a script outline, email newsletter or a draft of a marketing plan.
Plus, NotebookLM can now suggest actions based on whatever you’re currently doing. For instance, say you have selected a passage while reading a source. NotebookLM will automatically offer to summarize the text that you have selected into a new note or help you understand the content of the text. In another instance, say you’re writing a note. NotebookLM will offer to refine your prose or suggest related ideas from your sources based on what you have written so far.
Image Credits: Google
The tech giant is adding a new noteboard space to let you easily pin quotes from the chat or your own written notes. Google says the new space was a key request from users who said they wanted the ability to save their exchanges with NotebookLM as notes.
Google is also making a few other small tweaks to the product. Now when you add a note, NotebookLM will create an independent new note instead of adding to a single notepad. And when you click on the citation number in a chat response or a saved note, you will now immediately be taken to the original quote in the source.
If you want to concentrate exclusively on notetaking, you can now hide the source. And if you want to focus NotebookLM’s AI on selected sources, you can chat with a specific set of sources in your notebook by selecting them individually in the source sidebar. Plus, Google is adding PDF support and copied text support, which means you can now copy and paste text to create a new source and edit the title once it’s created.
In addition to the new features, Google is also expanding the product’s limitations, as notebooks can now include up to 20 sources, while a source can now include up to 200,000 words.
Today’s announcement comes around five months after the tech giant made NotebookLM available to a select few. Google first demoed its “AI notebook for everyone” during Google I/O earlier this year as Project Tailwind before renaming it to NotebookLM. At the time, Google said the app could be used by students as a way to organize their lecture notes and other documents when completing coursework.
NotebookLM is promising, but as TechCrunch’s Devin Coldeway previously noted, let’s hope the product doesn’t end up in the Google Graveyard like so many of the tech giant’s other experimental projects.

Title: X’s AI chatbot Grok now ‘rolled out to all’ US Premium+ subscribers, English language users are next
Content: Yesterday, X began rolling out Grok, the “rebellious” AI chatbot developed by Elon Musk’s xAI startup, to Premium+ subscribers on X’s platform. Today, Musk says that Grok’s rollout to all U.S. Premium+ subscribers is now complete, but cautioned that the beta would face many issues, though it would be steadily improved. He also offered a time frame for Grok reaching other markets beyond the U.S., noting that all English language users (who subscribe to Premium+) would gain access to Grok in “about a week or so.”
Japanese users, which is X’s second-largest user base, would then follow with the aim of bringing Grok to “hopefully” all languages by “early 2024,” the X owner said.
Grok AI (beta) is now rolled out to all 𝕏 Premium+ subscribers in the US.
There will be many issues at first, but expect rapid improvement almost every day. Your feedback is much appreciated.
Will expand to all English language users in about a week or so. Japanese is next…
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 8, 2023

Of course, Musk’s time frames for when things will happen don’t always come to pass — just ask any longtime Tesla watcher who spent time waiting on full self-driving (FSD). However, with Grok, Musk has only been a little behind in terms of his launch estimates. On November 22, for instance, Musk said that xAI’s Grok would launch to Premium+ subscribers “next week,” but the chatbot actually launched this week, on December 7.
Whether or not the chatbot is a success in driving subscription revenue for X still remains to be seen. For now, Grok is only part of X’s top-tier subscription offering — the $16 per month Premium+. That’s much pricier than X’s Basic ($3/mo) and Premium ($8/mo) options, and it’s not clear it will appeal to casual AI dabblers who can use rival chatbots like ChatGPT or Google’s Bard for free.
The Premium+ subscription comes with access to other features to broaden its appeal, including the benefit of seeing no advertisements in the For You and Following timelines on X. Premium+ users also have their replies boosted the most, in addition to all of Premium’s features like ads revenue sharing for creators, ID verification, a verified checkmark, access to Media Studio and more.
But so far, subscriptions haven’t driven the majority of X, formerly Twitter’s revenue — advertising has.
Yet now, it’s unclear what X’s ad-supported future may look like as Musk has been alienating X’s advertisers — even telling them to “fuck yourself” for leaving X over concerns of antisemitic content on the site. For X to be sustainable, it may need a larger number of users to subscribe to Premium+ for Grok to help shore up the loss of ad dollars as brands like Apple, Disney, IBM, Paramount, Walmart and others flee the platform.
Of note, X had its largest-ever month for subscription revenue in November, pulling in $6.2 million in net revenue, after app store fees, according to one estimate by app intelligence provider Apptopia. However, that’s still less than a third of what Snapchat made for its own in-app subscription, which topped $20 million for the first time last month.
In other words, there’s still plenty of room for X to grow subscribers, given it reportedly has more than 500 million monthly active users. Whether or not it can, of course, is another story.

Title: Startups are doing fine, but scale-ups and unicorns are in deep water
Content: It seems the younger a startup is today, the better its fundraising prospects.
Recent data from Carta pushes back against the narrative that 2023 has been tough on startups that are not building an AI product. In fact, grouping startups by maturity yields a very different picture.
The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.
Earlier-stage startups are seeing stronger valuations and smaller declines in total capital availability, welcome boons in a year of mostly negative news. However, late-stage investment has been in retreat, and since this segment usually accounts for the most dollars, people have been making the mistake of conflating a dramatic late-stage recession with general startup malaise.
We don’t mean to be glib. There are certainly many early-stage startups that are struggling and late-stage startups that are thriving. And Carta’s data is predicated on its customer base, which makes the information useful and directional, but not whole.
Still, the trends that we can spy are an effective argument against the logic of startups being encouraged to stay private as long as possible. For private-market investors looking to make the most of their investment, baking startups in the oven until they were fully ready worked for some time, but this method of running and scaling tech companies no longer looks so winsome.
Perhaps taking an early path to an IPO was the right idea all along. Let’s explore.
Parsing data from Carta on the third quarter of 2023, it’s clear that grouping startups by stage makes sense. For instance, the seed-stage was deemed to be immune to decline, but there’s only been a 58% decline in capital raised by seed-stage startups in Q3 2023 compared to Q4 2021. Meanwhile, Series A, B, and C rounds were all down 80% or more in value in the third quarter compared to Q4 2021.

Title: Deep tech startups must use these 4 techniques when fundraising
Content: In 2023, global investments are grappling with a substantial 15% downturn, as reported by Crunchbase, creating a challenging backdrop for early-stage startups. The uphill battle is naturally even more severe for deep tech startups developing novel, innovative solutions for upcoming markets.
Logically, their endeavors demand significant investment, and the accompanying risk further complicates the funding equation. According to Dealroom, funding of such companies from Europe saw a notable increase in 2021, likely spurred by a sudden surge in interest in AI. However, they subsequently experienced a significant decline in 2022, and this downward trend continues into 2023.
My international deep tech recently secured a $40 million seed round from various negotiations with venture funds, business angels, and diverse investment entities. Four techniques played a pivotal role in securing this funding for our venture.
One of the essential components in attracting potential investors is a well-known set of documents prepared for presentations. Among them, the pitch deck takes center stage, serving as the primary tool to articulate the essence of your idea and provide a glimpse into market dynamics.
Crafting a concise and compelling pitch deck is a crucial but well-known task, and plenty of sources are ready to inspire. But in many cases, the complexity of your product may be partially conveyed through it alone.
 

			Unless you’re Elon Musk, proving that you alone can create something technically sophisticated can be an uphill battle.					


After repeatedly facing the same questions about our product, we introduced an additional narrative format called a “product book.” While a pitch deck is a concise document, a product book dives deeper into the intricacies of your product, offering a more elaborate explanation. The questions you will be asked will likely be different from ours, but the main points of structuring this immersive guide still apply:

Title: Snapchat+ keeps growing as net revenue tops $20M for first time
Content: Snapchat’s premium subscription is showing no signs of slowing growth as it comes off its best month ever, in terms of in-app revenue, new data indicates. As it turns out, many of Snapchat’s younger users are willing to pay for the perks of Snapchat+, which offers tools to enhance stories, pin a Best Friend and change the app icon, as well as gain early access to new features, including new AI features, and much more. In November, the subscription offering topped $20 million in net revenue (after app store fees) for the first time, while subscription revenue rose by double digits in almost every country where Snapchat+ is live.
That puts Snapchat+ far ahead of X Premium, the subscription product formerly known as Twitter Blue. In November, X saw its highest month of in-app revenue purchase to date with $6.2 million in consumer spending, but it was still less than a third of what Snapchat+ is bringing in.

These findings, which come from app intelligence provider Apptopia, follow Snap’s announcement in September that its subscription offering had reached a milestone of over 5 million subscribers. That was up from 4 million in late June and 3 million in mid-April. Demand for the product had shown no signs of slowing, especially as the company introduced more early access features, including Snap’s latest AI products, like its My AI chatbot which rolled out to subscribers first, and expanded access to a generative AI selfie feature called Dreams. The My AI chatbot has been used to send over 20 billion messages, Snap announced during its Q3 earnings.
As a result, Snapchat+ is continuing to add subscribers for its now more-than-a-year-old subscription. Notes Apptopia, the subscription pulled in a total of more than $31 million in consumer spending before app store commissions, and was up 23.4% month-over-month, compared with October. While this wasn’t the largest-ever monthly increase as a percentage, it was the second-largest in terms of absolute revenue growth.
The top markets fueling the subscription’s consumer spending include the U.S., U.K., France, Australia and Canada. The U.S.’s net revenue led the month in November, growing from $1.3 million to $1.8 million. This was followed by the U.K. ($1.6 million net), France ($1.2 million net), Australia ($1 million net), and Canada ($960,000 net). Or, more simply put, the top 4 countries generated north of $1 million in revenue each for the Snapchat+ subscription.
Plus, the subscription is finding traction in unexpected areas as well, Apptopia found. For example, Saudi Arabia is the No. 7 market by consumer spending — something that isn’t common.
What’s more, this data doesn’t even offer the full picture for Snapchat+, as the company has made it possible for U.S. users to pay for a Snapchat+ subscription via gift cards sold on Amazon. Because those purchases are taking place outside the app stores, a third party like Apptopia wouldn’t be able to track that spending. That means Snapchat+’s revenue may be even higher than the firm’s estimates.

Title: The animated VTuber Ironmouse won Content Creator of the Year at the Game Awards
Content: This year at the Game Awards, the coveted Content Creator of the Year award went to Ironmouse, a fan-favorite VTuber. It marks the first time that an animated character has won the award, showing how expansive the streaming world can be.
A movement originating in Japan, “VTuber” means “virtual YouTuber,” though the genre has spread to other streaming sites like Twitch, where Ironmouse has 1.8 million followers and is the most-subscribed female streamer. VTubers often resemble anime characters, and the creators build their virtual personas by using motion-capture or AR face-tracking technology to embody their avatar. Though VTubers have been around for about a decade, they gained a boost in popularity at the onset of the pandemic, when the VTuber agency HoloLive launched its English-language division, catering to an expanded audience in the West. As the technology to make a VTuber becomes more accessible, the streaming genre only continues to grow.
Though the VTuber phenomenon is already widespread and beloved, the “fun loving demon” Ironmouse’s win at the Game Awards lends the genre even more legitimacy.

“Ironmouse couldn’t be here tonight, because Ironmouse is animated, and sadly, we’re not in the Matrix yet,” the host of the show said upon announcing Ironmouse’s victory.
Ironmouse’s intrigue doesn’t end with her innovative persona. Though we don’t know the identity of the creator behind Ironmouse, she has revealed that she is from Puerto Rico, and she is chronically ill with common variable immune deficiency (CVID) and a lung condition. At times, her chronic illness has left her bedridden, she told The Washington Post, but being a VTuber allows her to access a rich online world where she can be anyone who she wants to be — even a pastel pink-clad gamer escaped from hell. Last year, she streamed for 31 days straight as part of an annual “subathon” event, where viewers could pledge money to keep her online; she took on the streaming equivalent of an ultramarathon again this year, raising money for the Immune Deficiency Foundation.
“I have no words to describe how I am feeling right now,” Ironmouse wrote on X after her victory was announced. “I am in utter shock. Thank you all so much for changing my life.”

Title: Navigating 2024: The impact of interest rate plateau on financial startups
Content: Interest rates have plateaued at levels not seen in recent history, which means that startups and tech companies are likely operating in a business climate not seen recently: an elevated but stable interest rate environment. This rise in interest rates has primarily influenced the shift to a more challenging environment for startups over the past 18 months, impacting everything from VC/fundraising to top-line growth to daily operating costs. As we step into 2024, the question on everyone’s mind regarding interest rates is, How do we plan for the future? I recommend that companies focus on three things: (1) the return on investment (ROI) of innovation, (2) capital conservation, and (3) risk management.
In terms of emphasizing the ROI of innovation, growth is still paramount at tech companies, but they need to grow in a way that brings an ROI and ultimately yields cash flows. In their early years, most tech companies are financed by venture capital, specifically designed to fund enterprises that lose money initially, taking significant risks (and big losses) to ultimately realize outsize profits.
 

			The interest rate trajectory has been more stable over the past few months.					


This affair is still true today, and high growth is the primary indicator of a young company’s ability to eventually generate significant future cash flows. This is true in all interest rate environments. However, the nuance is that with higher rates, the value of future cash flows is discounted at a higher rate (worth less today), so the relative value of huge outsized future returns versus current losses is more muted.
The interest rate trajectory has been more stable over the past few months. At this elevated but not astronomical level, tech leaders should continue to emphasize investment and projects that will drive growth. Still, they should do so with more visibility — and tighter timelines to realize the benefits. Specifically, this means funding projects (often in product builds) with clear — at minimum — medium-term (six to 18 months) paths to increasing revenue and/or lowering costs.
This does not mean ignoring projects that impact only user experience; those are always relevant, but it means, for example, being clear on how that user experience improvement will drive product engagement that, in turn, moves a desirable metric (which in turn likely impacts revenue or cost). Explicitly state that metric movement and hold the project leaders accountable for it.

Title: Ex-Uber CSO Joe Sullivan on why he ‘had to get over’ shock of data breach conviction
Content: Before joining Uber as chief security officer in 2015, Joe Sullivan served for two years as a federal prosecutor with the United States Department of Justice, where he specialized in computer hacking and IP issues. He worked on a number of high-profile cases, from the first case in the U.S. of prosecution under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to the prosecution of a hacker who breached NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
More than 20 years after joining the U.S. government to help organizations defend against the so-called bad guys, Sullivan found himself on the other side of the justice system.
In October 2022, a San Francisco jury found him guilty on charges of obstructing an official proceeding and misprision of a felony (a failure-to-report-wrongdoing offense). In May this year, Sullivan was sentenced to three years probation.
The irony is not lost on Sullivan, who spoke to TechCrunch in London this week prior to his keynote speech at the cybersecurity conference Black Hat Europe.
This precedent-setting case pertains to a breach of Uber’s systems in 2016, where hackers threatened to expose the data of 50 million Uber customers and drivers. The verdict centered primarily around Uber’s decision not to report the breach to the Federal Trade Commission, as the company was mandated to report all breaches after an earlier 2014 hack of its systems exposed the names and driver’s license numbers of 50,000 people.
The case didn’t go as Sullivan, who was fired from Uber in 2017, had expected.
“We thought we were going to win the trial. We barely put on a defense because my lawyers were like, ‘we don’t need to.’ I didn’t testify, so the jury never saw me. They just saw the anonymous Uber executive with a mask on,” Sullivan told TechCrunch during the interview on Wednesday.
The first-of-its-kind verdict hit Sullivan hard initially. “When I lost the trial last October, I was in a funk, I didn’t want to talk to anybody, and I didn’t know what would happen to my life,” he said. “I just wanted to curl up in a ball.”
Sullivan’s case also caused anxiety among fellow CSOs and CISOs, a number of whom wrote letters to the case’s sentencing judge, William Orrick, praising Sullivan’s actions and voicing their fears that they too could face legal penalties for simply doing their jobs.
“Joe’s case has had a huge impact on the cybersecurity community,” one letter, signed by more than 50 CISOs, read. “It has been the subject of frequent executive team conversations and panel discussions at industry seminars, and a significant driver of efforts to change policies and practices to err on the side of disclosure, even when the legal requirement to do so remains unsettled.”
These fears have lasted long beyond Sullivan’s conviction. The former Uber CSO, who now works as CEO at a nonprofit dedicated to providing humanitarian and technology aid to the people of Ukraine, told TechCrunch that he receives calls every week from security professionals asking whether they should stay in the industry and whether they should take interviews for higher-ranking roles that come with greater responsibility — and greater risk.
“What I tell the security executives right now is that they shouldn’t run away from the job — they should run towards it,” Sullivan said, noting that the shared anxiety among cybersecurity professionals, along with the fact that he wanted to be a “better person,” is part of the reason he wanted to start speaking out about the Uber data breach case.
“I realized that sharing what I’ve gone through is better than not, and healthier for me. It’s taken me a year to say that, but that’s the right way to be,” Sullivan told TechCrunch. “I was very bitter, but I want to be a better person. I also want to continue being part of the security world, so I have to get over it.”
Sullivan told TechCrunch that another reason he’s keen to speak out is because of the fact that there have been “100 webinars, by 100 lawyers, saying that ‘you won’t end up like Joe if you have insurance, if you bring legal and PR into the room, or if you have a breach responsibility policy.’”
“We did all of those things [at Uber],” Sullivan said. “We had insurance; there was a data breach response policy; we looped in PR, and the CEO [Travis Kalanick] signed off on everything, including the dollar amount,” he added, referring to the $100,000 payment that was made to the two young men that discovered the vulnerability that led to the 2016 Uber breach.
When asked whether he believed Uber’s then-CEO should have been held responsible, Sullivan said: “I don’t think anybody did anything wrong at the end of the day.”
“Uber wouldn’t exist today — in fact, we would still be taking taxis — if it wasn’t for [Kalanick] and his sheer forcefulness,” Sullivan added. “On the upside, he drove some change in the world. However, on the downside, his philosophy was that the person who threw the first punch wins the fight.”
In what Sullivan describes as “the greatest irony of his career,” part of his role at the Department of Justice involved him working closely with organizations in Silicon Valley in order to encourage more collaboration with the government. “That’s been the story of my career; trying to get the public and private sectors to work together.”
Sullivan believes that going forward, this public-private sector collaboration, along with strong regulation, is the only way to fix the “broken” cybersecurity industry.
“When I joined, [Uber] had the worst security of any $40 billion company, and that can’t fly in the world anymore. If you’re going to sell a product, your security has to be good enough the day you sell it,” Sullivan said. “I could be very bitter about the idea of government regulation since I was regulated, but I also think we need it for the internet to work well in the future.”
Sullivan praised the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission’s incoming data breach disclosure rules, which come into effect on December 15, noting that while not perfect, it’s much better than having zero guidance. “We can nitpick the details as much as we want, but this is the right way to do it,” he said. “I seem to be the person who’s criticizing the SEC less than everyone else because I think we should praise them for trying to make rules.”
As for CSOs and CISOs, many of whom are still worried that they’ll be held personally liable for security failings at their organization, Sullivan believes that now is the time to speak out in order to shape any future regulation.
“We have to pull ourselves up, we have to learn the policy side of it, and we have to learn how to make our voice heard,” Sullivan told TechCrunch. “I think we have to develop leaders who can be real societal leaders who are experts in our profession.”

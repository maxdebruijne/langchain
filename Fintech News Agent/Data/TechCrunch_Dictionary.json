The bill would also require that these websites display a \u201cpublic health warning\u201d in 14-point font or larger, which states that watching pornography can cause mental illness and increase the demand for prostitution and child sexual exploitation.\n\u201cAlthough these warnings carry the label \u2018Texas Health and Human Services,\u2019 it appears that the Texas Health and Human Services Commission has not made these findings or announcements,\u201d wrote Judge Ezra.\nMany states have enacted laws in the last year that attempt to keep children away from inappropriate content by age-gating adult websites. But digital privacy advocates have voiced concerns for many years about the ways in which online ID verification can backfire.\nWhile HB 1181 does not allow companies or third-party verifiers to store retain identifying information about its users, this is difficult to guarantee or enforce.\n\u201cOnce information is shared to verify age, there\u2019s no way for a website visitor to be certain that the data they\u2019re handing over is not going to be retained and used by the website, or further shared or even sold,\u201d explains the Electronic Frontiers Foundation, a nonprofit advocating for civil liberties online.\nWhen a similar law passed in January in Louisiana, Pornhub conducted age checks via LA Wallet, a state-run digital drivers\u2019 license app. So, in order for an adult to access one of the web\u2019s most popular porn sites, they would have to share their government-issued ID.\nAdult sites can be fined for not complying with these laws. Under the bill in Texas, for example, the Attorney General can sue websites for $250,000 each time a minor is found to have accessed sexual material.\nOther laws like this have taken effect in Mississippi, Virginia and Utah. Learning from what happened in Louisiana, Pornhub decided to go dark in those states altogether. Instead, users will see a safe-for-work video in which adult actress Cherie DeVille explains why Pornhub doesn\u2019t support age-verification as a way of keeping minors safe online.\n\u201cWhile safety and compliance are at the forefront of our mission, giving your ID card every time you want to visit an adult platform is not the most effective solution for protecting our users,\u201d she said in the video.\nSites like OnlyFans and Pornhub require adult actors to prove their age and identity to cut down on nonconsensual content and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Still, Pornhub remains at the center of several pre-existing lawsuits regarding CSAM. But other porn sites have even fewer safeguards to ensure that actors aren\u2019t uploading exploitative content.\nThe judge\u2019s decision in Texas marks a departure from the precedent set by other states. But numerous other online age-verification bills like the Kids Online Safety Act are currently being considered.\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased that the Court agreed with our view that HB1181\u2019s true purpose is not to protect young people, but to prevent Texans from enjoying First Amendment protected expression,\u201d said Free Speech Coalition Executive Director Alison Boden in a statement. \u201cThe state\u2019s defense of the law was not based in science or technology, but ideology and politics.\u201d\nFan fiction writers rally fandoms against KOSA, the bill purporting to protect kids online\n\nPornhub blocks access in Mississippi, Virginia and Utah amid changing laws\n"}, "Grayscale wins lawsuit against SEC, while the agency settles first NFT case and Friend.tech hype crashes": {"Date": "Aug 31, 2023", "Author": "Jacquelyn Melinek", "Category": "Crypto", "Type": "This is a Free Article.", "Link": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/31/grayscale-wins-lawsuit-against-sec-while-the-agency-settles-first-nft-case-and-friend-tech-hype-crashes/", "Context": "Welcome back to Chain Reaction.\nTo get a roundup of TechCrunch\u2019s biggest and most important crypto stories delivered to your inbox every Thursday at noon.

This is coming from someone who literally had a dream about them this week. Pray for me. \nThere were cheers throughout the crypto community this week as Grayscale won its lawsuit against the SEC in regards to its bitcoin spot ETF application. While there\u2019s still a 45-day review period, many believe this is a step in the right direction.\nAlthough this was a win for the digital asset firm, the SEC was also making headlines separately for its suit against an NFT project, which was fined $6 million.\nMeanwhile, in decentralized social media land, the Friend.tech hype \u2014 which I covered and highlighted community skepticism about \u2014 has fallen as daily transactions plummeted. Details below.\n\nFor this week\u2019s new episode, Jacquelyn interviewed Craig Salm, chief legal officer at Grayscale Investments.\nGrayscale is a digital asset investment firm that aims to provide products and services, like its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), to institutional and individual investors. The company was founded in 2014 and is one of the world\u2019s largest digital asset currency managers. It currently owns 3.4% of outstanding bitcoin, \u201cworth tens of billions of dollars,\u201d according to a recent legal filing.\nAs mentioned above, the firm was making headlines this week after the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Grayscale in a lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the matter of a bitcoin ETF. This ruling is in response to the SEC denying Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its GBTC product into a bitcoin spot ETF in June 2022.\nWe discussed why the ruling matters for Grayscale and its GBTC investment vehicle; as well as what it could mean for the crypto ecosystem and other firms like BlackRock, Citadel and Fidelity that also filed applications for bitcoin spot ETFs.\nWe also talked about the SEC\u2019s argued difference between bitcoin futures ETFs, which have been approved by the agency, and bitcoin spot ETFs, which have not been approved by the agency.\nSubscribe to Chain Reaction on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or your favorite pod platform to keep up with the latest episodes, and please leave us a review if you like what you hear!\nThis list was compiled with information from Messari as well as TechCrunch\u2019s own reporting.\nWant to branch out from the world of web3?

Then, as the economy began to turn last year, that focus shifted pretty dramatically to profitability and being more financially sound. Salesforce was no different.\nSalesforce had been spending big over the prior years, acquiring companies like Slack for $27.7 billion, Tableau for $15.7 billion and MuleSoft for $6.5 billion, effectively buying growth in the process. Meanwhile, during the pandemic, like other large tech companies believing the work-from-home phenomenon would drive cloud profits long-term, Salesforce hired big, increasing the number of employees by 30% between 2020 and 2022.\nAs the cost of doing business increased with higher interest rates combined with inflation and currency headwinds, it had an impact on just about every company\u2019s revenue growth, including Salesforce\u2019s.\nThen last year, activist investors started taking a close look at Salesforce, forcing the company to rethink its growth strategy in the wake of a shifting economic landscape and activist demands for more financial discipline.\nCEO Marc Benioff steered the company through that turbulence by shifting its approach from the earlier growth orientation to one more focused on profitability. That meant cutting costs, which unfortunately resulted in laying off 10% of the workforce. In addition, the company announced in March that it was disbanding its M&A committee, a strong signal that the days of buying growth were over (at least for now).\nFor better or worse, the approach appears to have worked, with three consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. The circling activists backed off in March after a quarter in which the company reported 14% growth year-over-year. This quarter wasn\u2019t quite that good at 11% growth, but it beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations and even Salesforce\u2019s own projections by a fair amount, leaving Benioff very satisfied during the post-earnings call with analysts.\n\u201cSo, listen, as we\u2019ve shared with you over the last couple of earnings calls, Salesforce has really accelerated our transformation to profitable growth,\u201d he said during the call. \u201cI think that\u2019s super clear from the numbers, and I couldn\u2019t be more excited, especially on this huge top-line beat and what our margin is looking like today.\u201d\nSalesforce disclosed a top-and-bottom beat on Wednesday, besting expectations in terms of both revenue and profit. The company reported $8.60 billion in total top line, ahead of an anticipated $8.53 billion result. And it earned $2.12 per share, ahead of an expected $1.90 worth of adjusted per-share income.\nThat revenue result represented 11% year-over-year growth. More impressive, though, was how much Salesforce bolstered its profitability. Net income shot up from $68 million in the year-ago period to $1.27 billion in Salesforce\u2019s most recent quarter.\nThat massive profitability gain was not predicated on one-time gains from nonoperating results. In simpler English, the company\u2019s huge spike in profits was earned the old-fashioned way: keeping costs low while growing revenue.

Taking the bull by the horns, the company has proposed a few ways for teachers to put the system to use\u2026 outside its usual role as \u201cresearch assistant\u201d for procrastinating students.\nThe chatbot is controversial due to the dubious use case of unknown prevalence: plagiarism. Teachers around the world have caught or suspected students of having their essays written by ChatGPT, or using it to answer things like take-home quizzes. Depending on your opinion on educational methods this may be considered cheating, fair play, or something in between, but it is definitely throwing a wrench into lesson plans around the world.\nClearly OpenAI wants to rehabilitate the system\u2019s image a bit when it comes to education, so it has offered up a selection of, honestly, pretty compelling ways to put it to work in the classroom.\nFor instance, ChatGPT can be used to help language (especially English) learners to translate and write clearly and correctly. The system may not always get its facts right, but thanks to a corpus of largely correct writing, it is grammatically correct even while hallucinating. I\u2019ve heard this before from people who aren\u2019t native speakers of English and there\u2019s no reason to think it wouldn\u2019t be as useful to a 5th grader as it is to an adult.\nOpenAI also repeats experts saying (it is careful to put this in the context of educators making these suggestions themselves) that it could be helpful for formulating new test questions or role-playing as a job interviewer.\nPerhaps the most relevant suggestion, from Geetha Venugopal in Chennai, India, is to teach kids that they shouldn\u2019t trust everything a computer spits out at them:\nIn her classroom, she advises students to remember that the answers that ChatGPT gives may not be credible and accurate all the time, and to think critically about whether they should trust the answer, and then confirm the information through other primary resources. The goal is to help them \u201cunderstand the importance of constantly working on their original critical thinking, problem solving and creativity skills.\u201d\nIf those kids can learn that, they\u2019ll be doing what half the planet can\u2019t!\nNotably, in a FAQ, the first (and surely most frequently asked) question is about recognizing AI-generated content presented as a student\u2019s own work.\nTo OpenAI\u2019s credit, words are not minced:\nDo AI detectors work?\nIn short, no. While some (including OpenAI) have released tools that purport to detect AI-generated content, none of these have proven to reliably distinguish between AI-generated and human-generated content.\nThey warn against asking ChatGPT or other systems questions like \u201cdid you write this?\u201d as total misconstructions of what the model actually does. And they admit that \u201csmall edits\u201d are enough to avoid detection. Like removing the \u201cAs an AI, I\u2026\u201d bit that the laziest plagiarists fail to notice.\nOpenAI scuttles AI-written text detector over \u2018low rate of accuracy\u2019\n\nOpenAI recommends having students show their work and drafts, including conversations with AI models, and demonstrate that they are not simply asking it for answers and trusting them blindly. (If they were in M. Venugopal\u2019s class, they would know this.)\nThe company also helpfully includes some extensive prompts to put ChatGPT in the role of a tutor or assistant: \u201cYou are a friendly and helpful instructional coach helping teachers plan a lesson,\u201d and so on. While educators may not want to use these straight out of the box, simply reading them is suggestive of what kind of direction the agent needs in order to be helpful but not too helpful.\nIt\u2019s certain that AI agents like ChatGPT will be a fixture of education going forward, even if unfortunately there is great opportunity for abuse. But then again, who can say they did not install games on their TI-83 graphing calculator, or copy their report on Napoleon wholesale from Encarta? Well, a fair amount of young people, probably. But although I date myself, the parallels are clear.

Then, when it breaks or wears out, you\u2019ll have a much better picture of how you use the tool and how often you need it.\nIt\u2019s a counterintuitive form of common sense. Living by that rule, however, illustrates how awful a lot of products are. It\u2019s ridiculous how many times I\u2019ve ordered something from AliExpress only to realize it is of terrible quality and often not fit for the purpose. Still, \u201cpoorly made by the cheapest bidder\u201d is the name of that game, so perhaps terrible quality isn\u2019t that surprising. What I find far more worrying, though, is how often midrange products are, in a word, useless.\nSitting with this reminded me of the boots theory. Terry Pratchett\u2019s take on that theory in the Discworld series (Book 15, Men at Arms) presents a profoundly simple and poignant illustration of economic inequality and the implications of short-term versus long-term investment. Paraphrased, the theory argues that it\u2019s cheaper to buy expensive, high-quality goods that last a long time than buying cheaper, lower-quality goods more frequently.\nHowever, as we traipse deeper into late-stage capitalism, a paradoxical phenomenon is taking shape. Despite economic prosperity enabling more people to afford high-quality goods, there seems to be an overarching trend toward lower quality and disposability. In a nutshell: Even if you can afford high-quality products that are designed and built to last, it\u2019s becoming increasingly challenging to find and buy products that meet that bar.\nWhy is it that in a world rich in resources, technological advancements and consumer purchasing power, it\u2019s becoming harder to find high-quality, durable goods?

Where are these organizations in terms of maturity?\nNearly 68% of respondents are at the crawl stage, around 23% are at the walk stage, and 9% are at the run stage. And yet, Accenture research found only 42% have yet to achieve any material value from FinOps.\n \n\n\t\t\tWhile most IT leaders genuinely believe that FinOps is the answer to cloud cost complexity, it\u2019s clear there is still a lot left to learn.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nMoreover, many cloud industry leaders believe they\u2019ll have to wait years before seeing any positive outcomes from their FinOps practices \u2014 according to a recent study from CloudBolt Industry Insights (CII) conducted by Wakefield Research, 75% of respondents say they anticipate it will take 24 to 36 months.\nEven so, there remains an unprecedented commitment to the cloud, with 86% of companies reporting an increase in cloud initiatives, according to the same Accenture data. So, while most IT leaders genuinely believe that FinOps is the answer to cloud cost complexity, it\u2019s clear there is still a lot left to learn and build upon to make the best outcomes a reality.\nThe truth? FinOps is more than just a buzzword; it\u2019s a mindset that brings together finance, operations, and engineering teams in perfect harmony. By fostering a collaborative culture of cost transparency, FinOps instills a sense of shared responsibility across departments, allowing organizations to make informed decisions and optimize cloud resources efficiently.\nFrom this year\u2019s FinOpsX conference and beyond, here are some best practice takeaways you can consider to help ensure your cloud transformation is successful across every metric, with FinOps at the forefront of every decision.\nCreate a CCoE or a team or group of individuals within your organization responsible for creating and implementing cloud-related best practices, guidelines, and governance policies.\nBefore beginning your cloud journey, this team should present a \u201cstate of financial health\u201d using agreed-upon KPIs (key performance indicators) and discuss antipatterns, trends, and success blockers. It should comprise two cross-functional teams \u2014 often a cloud engineering team and a cloud steering committee.\nSome key responsibilities of a CCoE include the following:\nThe efficacy of cloud-based initiatives hinges on the coordinated efforts of people, processes, and technology to fulfill their pledged value. Although roles like cloud architects and other cloud-focused personnel are crucial for handling everyday cloud activities, it\u2019s equally vital for business stakeholders.\nThis group includes members of the C-suite, finance, legal, procurement, and various other internal teams to understand cloud technology fully. This knowledge will help formulate the business\u2019s most effective strategies and solutions.\nMeet with your cost leaders regularly to review cost trends, set optimization goals, remove blockers, enable, and train.

But last week\u2019s release of the anticipated web app on August 22nd appears to have little significant impact on Threads\u2019 usage, new data indicates. In the U.S., Threads\u2019 website traffic jumped up by 20% over the past week (through Monday) compared with the week prior, but it\u2019s not clear that this could be attributed to an influx of users, rather than to switchers moving from the native mobile app to the web.\nWorldwide, the traffic bump from the web app launch was only 3%.\nImage Credits: Similarweb\nThe data comes from digital intelligence firm Similarweb, which has been tracking Threads\u2019 adoption and the subsequent tapering off in usage following the app\u2019s blowout launch which saw it becoming the fastest app ever to reach 100 million users \u2014 a milestone it hit in just five days.\nBut since that time, Threads has seen traffic sink. Mobile intelligence firm Sensor Tower reported earlier this month that Threads\u2019 daily active users had dropped 82% since launch, and there were now just 8 million users accessing the app daily. The launch of the web app was a chance for Threads to reverse this trend as users had said they wanted a way to use the service more easily from their desktop.\n\u00a0\nBut it seems the web launch was largely catering to Threads\u2019 existing audience. Similarweb says the week-over-wee\nImage Credits: Similarweb\nk gain in Threads website visitors in the U.S. (+133,400) was larger than the drop in active app users (-82,400), but it doesn\u2019t have a way of determining the overlap between these two figures. However, it speculates this could indicate some current Threads users were likely moving from the app to the web.\nIn addition, its Android data indicates Threads\u2019 daily active users were down 15% worldwide and 2.4% in the U.S., during the same week-over-week comparison. This also suggests that Threads\u2019 web launch simply saw users switching from app to web, but didn\u2019t necessarily bring in new users or see lapsed users returning.\nToday, Threads announced it\u2019s testing search in Australia and New Zealand \u2014 another in-demand feature that would make the app more useful when compared with X (formerly Twitter).\nBut even search may not be enough to lure users back to Threads or see it gain new ones.\nThe issues around Threads adoption demonstrate the hold that X still has on the text-first social networking ecosystem. Despite X\u2019s many fumbles under Elon Musk, the app continues to offer a place where news breaks and trends are easily spotted \u2014 something that\u2019s more difficult to find on a competitor like Threads without key features like search, hashtags, and trends. These are what give X the feel of a global conversation hub and a real-time news network, and aren\u2019t as easy to replicate as simply building similar tools elsewhere.\nFor Threads to work, it also has to court the newsmakers and breakers to its platform, not just celebs you can already follow on Instagram. And so far, many of X\u2019s active users have either remained on the app or scattered elsewhere to networks like Bluesky and Mastodon, or perhaps smaller rivals like T2, Spill, Post, and others. Completely leaving X has seemingly proven difficult for longtime users, whose social connections still remain on the platform. That means Threads will have to do more than build the features users want in an X competitor, it will need to find a way to convince people to actually make the switch and then stick with it."}, "Grayscale\u2019s legal head says bitcoin spot ETF approval is a \u2018matter of when, not if\u2019": {"Date": "Aug 31, 2023", "Author": "Jacquelyn Melinek", "Category": "Market Analysis", "Type": "This is a Premium Article, and therefore only displays the first part of the article.", "Link": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/31/grayscales-legal-head-says-bitcoin-spot-etf-approval-is-a-matter-of-when-not-if/", "Context": "After the D.C.

But how exactly does knowing roughly where your bike is going to help you get it back?\n\u201cCustomers don\u2019t care if they can track their bike after a theft,\u201d James Dunn, co-founder of e-bike recovery startup BackPedal, told TechCrunch. \u201cHaving a GPS tracker actually doesn\u2019t enable their e-bike recovery. They think, \u2018Well, the police won\u2019t do anything. I don\u2019t want to go get my bike back. So what\u2019s the point?\u2019\u201d\nIn the hands of a single civilian who\u2019s furious about their stolen property, perhaps GPS isn\u2019t very useful. But in the hands of BackPedal, e-bike recovery seems like it might actually be possible.\nThe UK-based startup offers e-bike owners a monthly subscription service, which includes recovery of the e-bike and, more recently, insurance via Sundays Insurance, one of the largest cycle insurers in the UK. BackPedal says it has a 90% recovery rate, but the insurance provides a security net for the bikes that can\u2019t be brought back.\nThe subscription starts at \u00a38.99 per month but quickly climbs based on the value of a customer\u2019s e-bike.\nSuch a product will become increasingly relevant as e-bike adoption, and thus e-bike theft, continues to rise. One cycling insurance specialist, Cycleplan, has seen e-bike insurance policies rise 292% between 2019 and 2022, according to a report from Cycling Industry News. But that doesn\u2019t include the recovery operations, which the founders say is what most people want.\nIn their pre-business launch research, BackPedal found that 76% of potential customers would rather have their own stolen bike returned to them quickly, rather than going through the process of filing an insurance claim and getting a replacement bike.\n\u201cGPS has been done at scale,\u201d said Dunn. \u201cNailing the recovery operations is the hard bit that hasn\u2019t been done at scale.\u201d\nWhile BackPedal says its service is offered nationwide, most of the startup\u2019s operations are in London and Cambridge, as well as along the UK\u2019s southeast and south coast. One of BackPedal\u2019s commercial fleet customers from the UK also wants BackPedal to deploy in Amsterdam, which will provide an opportunity to test scaling the recovery model in another country.\nThat model involves working with both the police and a network of recovery agents. The recovery agents are usually ex-police officers or security professionals, contractors who have their own security businesses, who know the lay of the land and have relationships with the local police.\nOr sometimes it\u2019s just Dunn and his co-founder Richard White pounding the pavement in search of bikes.\nBackPedal has a remote operation center where someone receives the customer\u2019s request, tracks down the bike on the back end, manages the recovery agents and liaises with the local police.\nThe agents will do anything from knocking on the door and confronting the potential thief to hopping over fences and stealing the bike back.\n\u201cThey assess the situation, and if it\u2019s not dangerous, we tell them to go for it and retrieve it,\u201d White told TechCrunch. \u201cIf it\u2019s dangerous, we tell them to wait for the police.\u201d\nDunn said BackPedal has had success enlisting the help of police, despite the popular opinion that cops probably have better things to do with their time.\n\u201cIt\u2019s because we\u2019re not private citizens; we\u2019re actually BackPedal, a professional e-bike recovery firm, and we recover high-value stolen bikes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re learning how we can manage the police and part of that is around not expecting things to happen straightaway.\u201d\nBackPedal follows a process to get the police involved. Once a theft report comes in, the startup then reports it immediately to the police, sharing all available evidence like the type of bike, how it\u2019s being tracked and where it is.\n\u201cWe let them know we\u2019re professional. We\u2019re not emotionally attached. We\u2019re resourced and putting our people on the ground, and we\u2019re not going away,\u201d said Dunn. \u201cPolice do have a statutory duty to help with stuff like this.\u201d\nUltimately, Dunn (whose parents were police officers) said bike thefts are a thorn in the side of communities, and he wants BackPedal to get to the point where it\u2019s a trusted partner to the police.\nDunn says aside from building an on-demand network of recovery agents and integrating that with each police jurisdiction, BackPedal\u2019s main challenge is getting the hardware right.\n\u201cWhat is the hardware that enables reliable recovery? How does that change by vehicle type and use case and geography?\u201d\nAs e-bikes become smarter, they\u2019re increasingly being built with IoT, GPS and Bluetooth trackers. Bikes with GPS from BikeTrax, IoT Ventures and BikeFinder are on the company\u2019s approved tracker list because they are integrated within the bike (and thus can charge using the bike\u2019s battery), have a backup battery, have proven coverage and can be third-party access-enabled.\nFor bikes that don\u2019t have GPS installed, BackPedal offers an installation service \u2014 \u00a3225 for a professional fitting, or \u00a3150 for a fit at home guided by the team over WhatsApp.\nGPS can only get you so close to a bike. It might tell you what apartment building it\u2019s in, but can\u2019t get you to the actual unit. That\u2019s why BackPedal is also using additional beacon technology, which acts as a lighthouse that pings a signal every second via Bluetooth.\n\u201cIt basically means we can see behind walls, and that\u2019s something nobody is doing,\u201d said White, noting that the signal starts to be picked up within 50 meters of the bike\u2019s location via a smartphone.\nOne of the challenges for BackPedal as it grows is that the thieves will start to get better at what they do, so the startup will have to consistently deploy better hardware.\nSince January, BackPedal has grown at an average of nearly 20% per month, the founders said. Today the startup has 500 customers, but the goal is to reach 1,000 subscribers in the next five months.\nAdding the insurance was an important step for BackPedal in offering a more complete product that puts the startup in a better position to raise seed funding, a process BackPedal will consider starting in six months after growing the business more.\nIn the meantime, the company is working on healthy and sustainable growth. Learning each new market as it comes up, sourcing recovery agents and forming relationships with local police is essential to the process and will take time. Scaling will require a streamlined way to enter new markets, more GPS trackers on e-bikes, and continued work on the back-end software to manage the whole enterprise, said Dunn."}, "The Eve Play turns any classic stereo system into an AirPlay 2 speaker": {"Date": "Aug 31, 2023", "Author": "Romain Dillet", "Category": "Gadgets", "Type": "This is a Free Article.", "Link": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/31/the-eve-play-turns-any-classic-stereo-system-into-an-airplay-2-speaker/", "Context": "Eve, the manufacturer of smart home devices that work particularly with Apple\u2019s ecosystem and HomeKit, just unveiled a brand new device at IFA, a consumer electronics trade show.

(Minor early game spoilers ahead.)\nSound familiar? It should, as this is the general shape of half the space-based adventures out there. But where Starfield sets itself apart is in the scale of the game world and the player\u2019s freedom to explore it, boasting an open galaxy of a thousand planets. Admittedly, other games also attempt to set themselves apart this way, but let\u2019s move on.\nLike Skyrim, once you get past a few initial missions that introduce the characters and mechanics, you\u2019re more or less free to explore. But here we hit our first, and perhaps most important, issue.\nWhile its august predecessor and other open world games like Tears of the Kingdom, Elden Ring, and Horizon: Forbidden West take place in huge, continuous lands dotted with points of interest, Starfield\u2019s open world is spread over dozens of star systems and individual planets, which leads to a fundamentally less compelling form of exploration.\nDots\u2026 dots everywhere!\nInstead of walking or riding (or as in countless other space exploration games, flying) from point A to point B and finding activities and locations as you go, you select locations from the map: system, planet, and landing location.\nBut you don\u2019t actually fly there: the menu just takes you directly there via loading screen. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m exploring a vast galaxy so much as I\u2019m ordering a stellar object a la carte. Hmm, I\u2019ll try the Level 20 Atria VI, 2nd moon. And boom, there you are. Now land in the middle of nowhere and walk a few hundred meters to the only visible point of interest.\nMaybe this won\u2019t bother others as much as it does me. But part of the reason I play open world games at all is the sense of wonder, craft, and interconnectivity, best expressed in the (inevitable) moment your character steps out onto a precipice or out of a vault and the landscape opens itself up in front of you. That moment of wonder and anticipation simply doesn\u2019t exist in Starfield. In a way the review can end there \u2014 with the game completely neglecting to offer what to me is one of the most important aspects of the genre. But that would be unfair, as Starfield undoubtedly has its charms.\nImage Credits: TechCrunch / Bethesda\nFor one thing, the actual locations are really beautifully realized. The environment and object design in this game is absolutely fantastic. The aesthetic is marvelous and the execution is impeccable. I\u2019m doing a whole separate post on some of the wonderful gadgets, interfaces, doors, and other machines I\u2019ve encountered \u2014 I never thought I\u2019d look forward in a game to seeing how a new door opens, but it\u2019s a joy every time in this game. Buildings are realistically laid out, with bedrooms and bathrooms, workspaces, kitchens, and chock full of ordinary objects and snacks. So many snacks. \nI also really enjoy the spaceship design, interior and exterior, so it\u2019s a shame you seldom have any real reason to look at it. You can freely redesign your ship basically from scratch (Darrell\u2019s favorite part, so I\u2019ll let him elaborate on it), but ultimately when you\u2019re in space combat you\u2019ll probably be in first person, and the rest of the time the ship is just set dressing for your fast travel.\nThe cities, from shiny, clean New Atlantis to Cyberpunk-lite Neon and beyond, are also fairly impressive, with plenty of NPCs wandering around, mumbling about potential quests, and shops offering opportunities to stock up or commit various forms of theft.\nAnd there are plenty of unique locations to explore on story missions, which are deliberately designed and full of character. \u201cEnvironmental storytelling\u201d is a Bethesda core competency and it shows here.\nNon-flagship locations you find, however, tend to fall into one of a few categories: caves full of space pirates, abandoned facilities full of space pirates, and space stations full of space pirates. Some of them are mercenaries, or \u201cspacers,\u201d but unless you are currently on a faction quest for them or something, they\u2019re all just spacesuits pointing guns at you.\nSo you\u2019ll be shooting them a lot \u2014 there\u2019s no other way forward most of the time. If you were hoping to sneak through vents or hack your way through, sorry. Though a few missions rely on these tricks, for the most part it\u2019s kill or be killed. And combat is fun but pretty basic. You\u2019ll trade shots with anonymous (but cool) looking spacesuits peeping out of cover, or flank them with your jetpack \u2014 always satisfying, even if it feels a little unfair against their simple AIs. Most areas have a boss spacesuit with multiple health bars: utter bullet sponges that can take dozens or hundreds of shots to wear down.\nIf this is a little disappointing to those hoping for a Deus Ex-style choose-your-own-adventure, I\u2019m with you, but it bears remembering that the core gameplay loop of Skyrim was similarly \u201cfind a cave/tomb/base, annihilate all occupants and steal anything of value.\u201d Eventually we all became stealth archers \u2014 same here, but without the stealth.\nThere\u2019s a good variety of weapons, using a bewildering array of ammo types (some of which are rare but many of which you\u2019ll have thousands of rounds of after a few hours), and you can freely modify them once you acquire the pertinent skill. I\u2019ve had more luck picking up advanced guns by venturing into higher-level areas, but the freedom to opt at nominal cost for different ranges and styles is appreciated.\nImage Credits: TechCrunch / Bethesda\nThe main and faction missions have dialogue and some real rewards \u2014 which are interesting to find out on your own so I won\u2019t spoil them here. Keep your expectations mid; it\u2019s not much more impactful or interesting a story as Skyrim\u2019s, nor is it better told, nor are the characters (including your immortal puppy-dog companions) much more memorable or helpful. But they\u2019re better than the \u201ctask\u201d-level side quests, which are thick on the ground and uniformly pretty weak.\nI took on one of the first and seemingly simplest quest board tasks: to find a planet in a neighboring system that had some kind of solar seasons. Right away I\u2019m thinking, despite every stellar object being inhabited long enough ago to have abandoned facilities of some kind, this information isn\u2019t public record? Anyway, I had to visit each of half a dozen worlds and all of their moons individually (via menu) to scan them (via menu), then explore some on foot scanning everything in sight to find which had the \u201ctrait\u201d \u2014 none, that I could tell. I gave up on this unrelentingly tedious quest and decided to never visit the board again.\nBut in the process, I found some interesting planets\u2026 just kidding. The planets were all pretty samey, and I found an exact copy of a facility I had encountered a couple hours earlier \u2014 a perfect copy in every respect, though the space pirates were of a different flavor. This has happened many times since then: same facility, same layout, same enemies, same dead scientists or colonists in the same positions, same chests in the same rooms. (All while your companion shouts the same battle cries and non sequiturs.)\nOn one moon-scanning surface expedition, I saw a ship land a ways off. I bounced over to see if I could help its occupants, or shipjack them. I found the captain ambling around a nearby building. She needed ship parts to fix their ship, she said. I didn\u2019t have any. But ten feet away was an unlocked chest with one (1) ship parts inside (and some money and a gun, and some snacks). I gave her the ship parts, thinking perhaps this would be the start of a quest chain. She said \u201cwow, thanks!\u201d and continued her walk. The end!\nAnd I found a moon called Worthless, presumably so-called because it is a barren rock with not only no life on it, but only two mineral resources to scan and collect; some planets have 6 or 7, plus as many flora and fauna to find. Nevertheless, what did I find but a science base \u2014 and amazingly, it was occupied, not by pirates\u2026 but botanists! A team of botanists on an utterly barren planet. And when I walked up to one, he grabbed me to say that they had been attacked in a nearby cave by the local monsters. But the planet has no monsters, I wanted to tell him. I went to the cave, a two minute walk away, and found their friend about 50 feet in. Sure enough, no monsters to be found, there or anywhere else on the planet. Fast traveled back to the outpost and collected my 4,000 credits.\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that if the 950 planets that aren\u2019t part of some main quest chain are going to be filled with this kind of thing, I see little reason to visit. It more or less put me off \u201cexploring\u201d altogether. If you stick to the larger scale scripted quests (these are clearly communicated), and only bother with unique locations (also pretty easy to tell apart) you\u2019ll have a less tedious time of it than I did. There are fun stories to be encountered here and different ways of navigating them, but you have to learn to spot the fool\u2019s gold.\nImage Credits: TechCrunch / Bethesda\nAlthough Starfield has grown on me as I\u2019ve played it \u2014 I\u2019ve put in many hours even as I catalogued its shortcomings \u2014 I feel like there\u2019s something missing at the very heart of it. (I thought it was too cruel to title the review \u201cMass Defect\u201d but I suspect others less kind may take the opportunity.)\nAnd I felt it from the start. The very first mission has you exploring an outpost where scratches on the walls, messy bodies, and various logs describe a project to equip some terrible sharp-clawed creature with a device to make it into a bioweapon. Of course this has gone wrong and everyone\u2019s dead. As you work your way through, the expectation that one of these creatures will appear grows and grows. You emerge onto the roof, an obvious final confrontation point, and are attacked! \u2026By space pirates.\nThere never was a creature \u2014 it was a fake-out, a story about as relevant to your playthrough as any of the Dickens books seemingly everyone in the galaxy is reading (I jettisoned six copies of Hard Times from my ship! I need that inventory space). Or if there is one, it was too valuable a payoff for them to just give you without 10 or 12 more jumps and dialog trees. Most, though not all, of the missions and locations I experienced echoed this in some way, whether they were procedural or crafted. Like a lackluster main course smothered in garnish, all the parsley and croutons are there to disguise the fact that you\u2019re not playing Skyrim in space, you\u2019re playing a decent corridor shooter with extremely laborious level selection.\nYou want to explore the galaxy, but you can\u2019t, because there is no galaxy, only more menus. What you do encounter, while it\u2019s rendered beautifully a lot of the time, is too often frustratingly banal. You can still have a good time, and I certainly have as I\u2019ve embraced the game for what it is. Many people want to romp through space and blast pirates and robots (and behave more badly than I did, probably) and don\u2019t really care about that absence of wholeness and wonder. But after years of hype and the advances to the genre, I can\u2019t help but feel it falls far short of its own ambition, and likely the expectations of gamers.\nThere\u2019s also every chance this review will grow irrelevant as the game is improved on, modded, and refined the way Skyrim has been for a decade. Let\u2019s hope Starfield shines brighter in the future."}, "Reed Jobs will discuss his new venture firm at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023": {"Date": "Aug 31, 2023", "Author": "Lauren Simonds", "Category": "Startups", "Type": "This is a Free Article.", "Link": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/31/reed-jobs-will-discuss-his-new-venture-firm-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2023/", "Context": "You may be more familiar with his father, Steve Jobs, but Reed Jobs aims to make his own impact on the world by making cancer nonlethal.

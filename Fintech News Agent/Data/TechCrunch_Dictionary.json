Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.\nIt\u2019s sometimes hard to remember that, as a startup founder, you have influence over aspects of your business that you wouldn\u2019t have if you were a cog in a giant machine somewhere. In one of my past companies, we went very far out of our way to ensure that our packaging was fully biodegradable, but still a lot of fun. In another, we ensured that all our server use was carbon-offset. In a third, we had regular standups and brainstorms to figure out how we could have less of an impact on our planet.\nAll of which is to say: As a startup founder, you have a beautiful luxury. You are the master of your destiny, and your passions and interests get to be those of your startup. The inverse is also true: If you don\u2019t care about climate change, diversity, or equality, your company as a whole is a lot less likely to make those topics a priority.\nOne way that this is showing up for me is that, even if you have money to spend, it\u2019s really hard to find genuinely high-quality products that will last you a lifetime. The Sam Vimes \u201cboots\u201d theory of socioeconomic unfairness, often called simply the \u201cboots theory\u201d popularized by Terry Pratchett in the Discworld series, speaks to that. And in my column for the week, All products are garbage, and for good reason, I continue the philosophical meandering to see how that might apply to startups, too.\nIn other news, it caused some nervous giggles in the TechCrunch newsroom that Connie\u2019s promotion was scooped by Axios, but I respect a good scoop, and so I am begrudgingly linking to our arch-enemy\u2019s coverage of our leadership change. Of course, we wrote some ourselves, too: Panzer\u2019s retrospective of his decade in the Big Chair at TechCrunch\u00a0and Connie\u2019s cigar-puffing reception of the proverbial editorial baton.\nImage Credits: Pixabay (opens in a new window) under a CC0 (opens in a new window) license.\nMergers and acquisitions are a crucial part of the startup ecosystem: Acquisitions are one of two ways (the other being an IPO) that startups can get a liquidity event, or an \u201cexit,\u201d as they are often called. It\u2019s pretty rare that a startup goes on an 80-mom-and-pop buying spree, but that\u2019s the phenomenon our new editor in chief Connie sniffed out this week.\nApropos IPOs, we have our first Big Tech IPO of the year, and Alex and Mary Ann dove into Instacart\u2019s S-1 document to see what they could learn.

This week, we saw a significant uptick in interest in articles around fundraising, so perhaps there\u2019s a lot of startups that are preparing for the fundraising season that kicks off immediately after Labor Day. So, what\u2019s going on? I took a look at the 5 trends in VC funding for pre-seed startups.\nOne of the most-read articles on TC+ this week was my own: Never express your \u2018use of funds\u2019 slide as percentages. It\u2019s one of the things to keep in mind when you are trying to explain what you are going to do with that fresh money you are in the process of raising. The \u2018use of funds\u2019 slide is the part of the narrative that almost every founder gets wrong. The other thing founders screw up is looking at fundraising as unlocking runway. That\u2019s true, but honestly, nobody gives a crap about your runway: If you can hit your milestones in eight to nine months instead of 18, that\u2019s fine. If you need two years to hit your goals, that\u2019s fine too (as long as you don\u2019t run out of cash along the way). In a nutshell: It\u2019s all about milestones.\nIncidentally, if you are on the fundraising trail, TechCrunch has an incredible, in-depth guide to almost every aspect of building a deck and getting it in front of investors. You need a TC+ subscription, but honestly, it\u2019s the best $99 you\u2019ll ever spend. Hell, even though I write for TC+ and I could probably get a free subscription, I pay for my own, that\u2019s how much I love it.\nHere\u2019s a few other nuggets to take with you on the fundraising trail:\nThe order matters: But there\u2019s no such thing as a standard order for your slides. Here\u2019s how to prioritize and think about the right order of slides for your story.\nNail your marketing story: Founders, \u201cwe haven\u2019t spent a penny on marketing\u201d isn\u2019t the brag you think it is.\nThink about your last impression: First impressions matter, but it\u2019s good to remember that you have an opportunity to leave a parting gift, too. Make it count.\nRobot DJ.

Maybe we\u2019ll finally get USB-C charging, too, after it was left off the iPhone 14 spec, much to my ever-lasting chagrin. Pixel fans have to wait an additional three weeks or so: Google\u2019s Pixel 8 event is set for October 4.\nAudeze makes high-end gaming and audio production headphones, and it seems like Sony\u2019s PlayStation division took note: Sony is buying Audeze, the company confirmed to Brian this week. Sony is also in the news because it finally made the $200 PlayStation Portal in-home handheld official, after a few false starts.\nSure, you can open up our gadgets: Brian reports that Apple lends support to California\u2019s Right to Repair bill, penning a letter to California state senator Susan Talamantes Eggman, including \u201cApple supports California\u2019s Right to Repair Act so all Californians have even greater access to repairs while also protecting their safety, security, and privacy.\u201d\nWelcome to retirement \u2014 here\u2019s your companion robot: ElliQ is a desktop home robot designed to serve as a kind of robotic companion for elderly users.

Globalstar entered into a $327 million purchase agreement with MDA for those satellites in February last year, with Rocket Lab acting as subcontractor supplying the spacecraft chassis.\nApple is reimbursing Globalstar for 95% of the capital expenditures related to the satellites, including the launch costs. The consumer hardware giant also agreed to provide $252 million in funding for the upfront costs associated with replenishing the satellite constellation, as well as money to improve the satellite operator\u2019s ground station network.\nIn return, Apple said it would use 85% of Globalstar\u2019s network capacity to provide emergency satellite connectivity for iPhones outside of cellular networks.\nThe new contract reflects the near-monopoly SpaceX currently holds on orbital launches. SpaceX is also developing its own \u201csat-to-cell\u201d plans through its Starlink satellite constellation, making it and Globalstar something of competitors. That competition became stark last year, when SpaceX filed a request with regulators for more spectrum for its Starlink, including portions of the 1.6/2.4 GHz spectrum bands that have been used exclusively by Globalstar."}, "Tesla packs higher-end Model S and X features into Model 3 refresh": {"Date": "Sep 01, 2023", "Author": "Harri Weber", "Category": "Transportation", "Type": "This is a Free Article.", "Link": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/01/tesla-packs-higher-end-model-s-and-x-features-into-model-3-refresh/", "Content": "\nTesla (or at least Tesla Europe) is finally ready to talk about its long-awaited, mid-cycle Model 3 refresh.\nThe revamped vehicle will ship with several features that were previously exclusive to Tesla\u2019s pricier models.

And this tendency is not without consequence. One report suggested that the industry loses over $8.3 billion a year due to being a late or non-adopter of technology like advanced electronic health records.\n \n\n\t\t\tPublic health researchers and biomedical engineers have been quietly cultivating an AI-fused revolution in medicine, with addiction prevention and treatment the newest beneficiary.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nBut the opioid epidemic\u2019s tolls are greater than the ones on the ledgers. Going back to 1999, over 1 million people have died due to a drug-related overdose. In 2021, 106,699 drug overdose deaths occurred in America, among the highest per capita volume in the history of the country. Around 75% of all of these overdoses were attributable to the usage of opioids, which includes prescription painkillers like Vicodin and Percocet as well as \u201cstreet\u201d drugs like heroin.\nDespite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health pouring billions of dollars into outreach, education, and prescription monitoring programs, the epidemic has remained stubbornly persistent.\nFor the past decade, I have been conducting research on the opioid epidemic in rural and urban communities across America, including New York City and rural southern Illinois.\nMost in my field agree, albeit reluctantly, that there\u2019s an incredible amount of guesswork involved in identifying the intricate risks that drug users face. Which drugs will they get? Will they inject, snort, or smoke them? Who, if anyone, will they use around, in case they overdose and need help?\nThat\u2019s not it. Practitioners are also regularly combating idiosyncratic federal and state guidelines on effective treatments for opioid use disorder, like suboxone. And they also find themselves playing catch-up with increasingly unpredictable drug supplies that are contaminated with cheap, synthetic opioids like fentanyl, which is largely responsible for recent surges in opioid-related overdose deaths.\nWhile AI developments like ChatGPT have been what has captured the imagination of most of the public, public health researchers and biomedical engineers have quietly been concocting an AI-fused revolution in medicine, with addiction prevention and treatment the newest beneficiaries.\nInnovations in this space primarily use machine learning to identify individuals who may be at risk of developing opioid use disorder, disengaging from treatment, and relapse. For example, researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology recently developed machine-learning techniques to effectively identify individuals on Reddit who were at risk of fentanyl misuse, while other researchers developed a tool for locating misinformation about treatments for opioid use disorder, both of which could allow peers and advocates to intervene with education.\nOther AI-fueled programs, such as Sobergrid, are developing the capacity to detect when individuals are at risk of relapsing \u2014 for example, based on their proximity to bars \u2014 then linking them to a recovery counselor.\nThe most impactful developments relate to reduction of overdoses, often brought on by mixing drugs. At Purdue University, researchers have developed and piloted a wearable device that can detect signs of overdose and automatically inject an individual with naloxone, an overdose-reversing agent. Another crucial development has been the creation of tools to detect hazardous contaminants in drug supplies, which could radically reduce fentanyl-fueled overdoses.\nDespite this immense promise, there are concerns \u2014 could facial recognition technology be used to locate people who appear high, leading to discrimination and abuse? Uber already took a step in developing this kind of capacity\u00a0in 2008, attempting to patent a technology that would detect a drunk passenger.\nAnd what about dis/misinformation, a problem already plaguing chatbots? Might malicious parties embed incorrect information into chatbots to mislead drug users on risks?\nGoing back to Fritz Lang\u2019s seminal silent film \u201cMetropolis\u201d in 1927, the public has been fascinated by the idea of new, humanlike technology making lives easier and richer. From Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d in 1968 to films like \u201cI, Robot\u201d and \u201cMinority Report\u201d in the early 2000s, though, these wistful visions have slowly morphed into a kind of existential dread.\nIt will be up to not just researchers and clinicians, but also patients and the broader public to keep AI honest and from turning humanity\u2019s grandest challenges, like the opioid epidemic, into insurmountable ones."}, "X\u2019s privacy policy confirms it will use public data to train AI models": {"Date": "Sep 01, 2023", "Author": "Sarah Perez", "Category": "Apps", "Type": "This is a Free Article.", "Link": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/01/xs-privacy-policy-confirms-it-will-use-public-data-to-train-ai-models/", "Content": "X\u2019s recently updated privacy policy informed its users it would now collect biometric data as well as users\u2019 job and education history, Bloomberg spotted earlier this week. But it appears that\u2019s not the only thing that X plans to do with user data. According to an update to another section of the policy, the company additionally plans to use the information it collects and other publicly available information to help train its machine learning and AI models, it says.\nThe change was noticed by Alex Ivanovs of Stackdiary, who has a history of finding notable updates in the terms of service of tech companies, having previously found AI-related updates in Brave and Zoom. His post is now trending on Y Combinator\u2019s discussion forum Hacker News.\nSpecifically, the X policy change is found in section 2.1 and reads as follows:\nWe may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purposes outlined in this policy.\nAs Ivanovs points out, X owner Elon Musk has ambitions to enter the AI market with another company, xAI. This leads him to theorize that Musk likely intends to use X as a source of data for xAI \u2014 and perhaps Musk\u2019s recent tweet encouraging journalists to write on X was even an attempt to generate more interesting and useful data to feed into the AI models.\nIn fact, Musk has previously stated that xAI would use \u201cpublic tweets\u201d to train its AI models, so this is not much of a leap. He accused other tech giants of leveraging Twitter to train their AI models, even threatening Microsoft with a potential lawsuit for alleged illegal use of Twitter data. Musk also filed suit against unknown entities for scraping Twitter data, which also may have been for the purpose of training artificial intelligence large language models.\nIn addition, Ivanovs points to to the text on the xAI homepage which states that while it\u2019s a separate company from X Corp., it \u201cwill work closely with X (Twitter), Tesla, and other companies to make progress towards our mission.\u201d\nMusk essentially confirmed the privacy policy change, responding to a post on X to clarify that the plan is to use \u201cjust public data, no DMs or anything private.\u201d\nJust public data, not DMs or anything private\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 31, 2023\n\nX no longer responds to press requests with a poop emoji as it had following Musk\u2019s takeover of the social network.

Often, a heck of a lot. And when a group of startups works on a similar set of problems, they frequently bring about massive shifts in how day-to-day life is lived. In the case of financial access in Latin America, new data indicates that startups have had a large, and measurable, impact.\nAs the global venture capital market has contracted, Latin American startups have raised significantly less than they used to compared to other markets that TechCrunch tracks. This is not a new trend by any means, but the figures are stark now that we\u2019re more than halfway through 2023.\nThe Exchange explores startups, markets and money. \nRead it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.\nA new Atlantico report indicates that venture capital volumes (measured in billions of dollars) in Latin America declined 65% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to a year earlier. Notably, that indicates that investment in fintech, the category that has historically attracted the most capital in the region, also declined in the region. \n\nIt is obviously not encouraging that Latin American startups are facing a more severe lack of funding than other markets right now \u2014 not all news there is bad, it\u2019s worth noting \u2014 but to look at only the bad news of the moment would mean we\u2019re effectively ignoring how much impact startups in the region have had. In particular, we\u2019re talking about the impact of startup investment, fintech and Latin American consumer finance. \n\nInvestors show Latin American fintech startups the money\n\nIn Latin America, fintech has long been a sector that startups have loved to tackle. It is not hard to understand why: The region was, and remains, significantly underbanked than many other large countries. In its report, Atlantico compares Latin America to India and the United States, noting that from 2011 to 2017, the rate of bank account penetration in LatAm rose from 39% to 55%. In contrast, India saw penetration soar from 35% to 80% in the same period, while the United States had a more modest 88% to 93% gain.\nThings look different after 2017, though. Bank account penetration rose from 55% in Latin America to 74%, while in India, it receded from 80% to 78%.\nNo national statistic is influenced by a singular factor, so we do not want to overstate the case.

It holds tremendous potential value, but we cannot contribute meaningfully to a technology that we do not understand.\nWhen a user sets out to buy a new piece of technology, they\u2019re not particularly interested in what it might be able to do somewhere down the road. A potential user needs to understand what a solution will do for them today, how it will interact with their existing technology stack, and how the current iteration of that solution will provide ongoing value to their business.\nBut because this is an emerging space that changes seemingly by the day, it can be hard for these potential users to know what questions they should be asking, or how to evaluate products so early in their life cycles.\nWith that in mind, I\u2019ve provided a high-level guide for evaluating an AI-based solution as a potential customer \u2014 an enterprise buyer scorecard, if you will. When evaluating AI, consider the following questions.\nChatbots, for example, perform a very specific function that helps promote individual productivity. But can the solution scale to the point where it is used effectively by 100 or 1,000 people?\nThe fundamentals of deploying enterprise software still apply \u2014 customer success, change management, and ability to innovate within the tool are foundational requirements for delivering continuous value to the business. Don\u2019t think of AI as an incremental solution; think about it as a little piece of magic that completely removes a pain point from your experience.\nBut it will only feel like magic if you can literally make something disappear by making it autonomous, which all comes back to truly understanding the business problem.\nData security implications around AI are next level and far outstrip the requirements we are used to. You need built-in security measures that meet or exceed your own organizational standards out of the box.\n \n\n\t\t\tHere\u2019s a high-level guide for evaluating an AI-based solution as a potential customer \u2014 an enterprise buyer scorecard, if you will.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nToday, data, compliance, and security are table stakes for any software and are even more important for AI solutions. The reason for this is twofold: First and foremost, machine learning models run against massive troves of data, and it can be an unforgiving experience if that data is not handled with strategic care.\nWith any AI-based solution, regardless of what it is meant to accomplish, the objective is to have a large impact. Therefore, the audience experiencing the solution will also be large. The way you leverage the data these expansive groups of users generate is very important, as is the type of data you use, when it comes to keeping that data secure.\nSecond, you need to ensure that whatever solution you have in place allows you to maintain control of that data to continually train the machine learning models over time. This isn\u2019t just about creating a better experience; it\u2019s also about ensuring that your data doesn\u2019t leave your environment.\nHow do you protect and manage data, who has access to it, and how do you secure it? The ethical use of AI is already a hot topic and will continue to be with imminent regulations on the way. Any AI solution you deploy needs to have been built with an inherent understanding of this dynamic\nAs ML models age, they begin to drift and start to make the wrong conclusions. For example, ChatGPT3 only took in data through November of 2021, meaning it couldn\u2019t make sense of any events that occurred after that date.\nEnterprise AI solutions must be optimized for change over time to keep up with new and valuable data. In the world of finance, a model may have been trained to spot a specific regulation that changes along with new legislation.\nA security vendor may train its model to spot a specific threat, but then a new attack vector comes along. How are those changes reflected to maintain accurate results over time? When buying an AI solution, ask the vendor how they keep their models up to date, and how they think about model drift in general."}, "Magic Leap\u2019s original headset will stop working at the end of 2024": {"Date": "Sep 01, 2023", "Author": "Brian Heater", "Category": "Hardware", "Type": "This is a Free Article.", "Link": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/01/magic-leaps-original-headset-will-stop-working-at-the-end-of-2024/", "Content": "As a company, Magic Leap moved on from its first headset some time ago. Along with a new CEO came a major pivot. With the Magic Leap 2, the startup went all in on enterprise \u2014 a far safer and more lucrative bet than the fickle world of gaming.\nStill, the Magic Leap 1 has continued to operate \u2014 good news for those who shelled $2,300 for the device when it finally arrived in the summer of 2018. At the end of next year, however, the augmented reality headset will effectively become a very expensive hunk of plastic and glass.\nThe well-funded firm alerted users via email that the system is being end-of-lifed when 2025 rolls around.\n\u201c[W]e are announcing that Magic Leap 1\u2019s end-of-life date will be December 31, 2024. Magic Leap 1 is no longer available for purchase but will continue to be supported through December 31, 2024,\u201d the company writes.\nShorter term, the product\u2019s various communications are being shuttered. The Magic Leap 1 Developer Forum and Discord channels are both being shuttered at the end of the month, while the company recommends people shift their business to the Magic Leap 2 board instead. Troubleshooting support and warranty claims will continue to be honored through 2024.\nMore details are offered in an FAQ.\nWhen that date rolls around, however, cloud services, apps and general functionality will all effectively brick. Perhaps we\u2019ll see a homebrew community emerge, though the true number of devices out in the wild is hazy, at best. One report suggested that the headset had sold around 6,000 devices in its first year.\nMuch of that modest figure can be chalked up to pricing, along with the age-old issue of limited content. You can\u2019t, however, blame the technology. If AR\u2019s time ever truly comes, we can safely say that the Magic Leap 1 was ahead of it. And the device\u2019s sequel continues to build on that success.\nFrom my conversation with the company, it\u2019s safe to say Magic Leap has no short-term ambitions to return to the consumer market. Maybe someday scale will bring the price down to a manageable level and enough developers will be entrenched in the ecosystem to offer something meaningful.\nIn the meantime, the ball is very much in Apple\u2019s court with the Vision Pro. While the software giant\u2019s spatial computing approach is fairly different than what Magic Leap had initially targeted, it\u2019s fair to say the two share common DNA. This is also a relatively rare instance where Apple entering the category doesn\u2019t suck the air out of the room for smaller competitors. If anything, the Vision Pro is a validation for AR\u2019s true believers.\nI will be discussing Magic Leap\u2019s journey with CEO Peggy Johnson as part of the Disrupt Hardware Stage, later this month."}, "Kyle Vogt to discuss self-driving cars, AI, investing and more at TC Disrupt 2023": {"Date": "Sep 01, 2023", "Author": "Lauren Simonds", "Category": "Startups", "Type": "This is a Free Article.", "Link": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/01/kyle-vogt-to-discuss-self-driving-cars-ai-investing-and-more-at-tc-disrupt-2023/", "Content": "Cruise, the self-driving subsidiary of General Motors, has raised over $15 billion, employs more than 3,000 people and expanded its footprint across multiple cities within the U.S. It even has a presence in Dubai.

The move comes after the New York-based company raised $380 million in equity and debt in the past two years.\nAccording to the filing, the company sought protection from creditors in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, listing both assets and liabilities ranging from $50 million to $100 million.\nThe company was founded by Benedict Dohmen and Santiago Nestares in 2016. TechCrunch initially profiled the company in March 2021 when it raised $55 million in both equity and debt to fund acquisitions of brands built to sell on Amazon\u2019s marketplace.\nLater in 2021, the company raised again, this time a whopping $325 million in Series A equity and debt, led by CoVenture, to, among other things, develop an M&A arm of the company.\nHowever, in November 2022, Dohmen told TechCrunch that despite some rumors to the contrary, the company was still in business, though it had to lay off 14% of its staff. The cuts were made primarily in that M&A arm.\nBenitago had about $7.5 million in cash at the time of the filing; Nestares said as part of the bankruptcy filing that \u201cconsumer preferences shifted during the later stages of the pandemic when lockdowns ended,\u201d according to The Wall Street Journal.\nIndeed, in 2021, the e-commerce roll-up, or aggregator, market was growing rapidly and companies joined Benitago in raking in large amounts of venture capital to continue that aggressive momentum.\nThat said, e-commerce growth has been relatively flat these days. And that aggressive acquisition of third-party e-commerce brands? It has slowed down. There\u2019s even been some consolidation within the aggregator sector. And few of these kinds of companies saw venture capital come their way in recent months.\nMeanwhile, Benitago has plans to restructure its debt and potentially sell off some parts of its business in bankruptcy.

Guess who\u2019s back with another company? Luo has raised $1.5 million for Tanbii from a Hong Kong family office.\nIn general, I would be suspicious of a founder raising money for a second startup less than a year after they got funded for another. I\u2019m eager to see how that\u2019s been addressed in the Tanbii deck.\nAs for Mi Terro? It\u2019s still going: \u201cMi Terro is doing amazingly well. We gained a lot of great traction and plan to raise another round later this year,\u201d Luo told me in an email.\nOf course, this puts me in an exciting situation: I get to look back at what I said could be improved in Mi Terro\u2019s pitch deck (market sizing, traction, and the absence of a competition slide) last year and see how the founder has addressed these issues for his new company.\nWe\u2019re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here\u2019s how you can do that.\u00a0\nRight out of the box, I love that the company\u2019s founder is staying in the same industry (carbon reduction) as his previous company. It makes it easy to accept the narrative that while building one company, he saw an opportunity for another.\nOn slide 2, the company comes out of the gate with a clear problem: consumer carbon emissions.\n[Slide 2] Problem slide. Image Credits: TanbiiTanbii is presuming that people care about their own personal CO2 emissions, and it seems that\u2019s not a bad call: A large survey and research study from Yale shows that 65% of people believe that citizens should do more to address global warming. On the other hand, only 35% of respondents discuss global warming from time to time. The survey didn\u2019t ask whether people are struggling to find ways to make an impact.\nMost people agree that reducing CO2 is a good idea, even though it seems many of us are feeling pretty powerless, which is the problem space Tanbii is buzzing into.\n[Slide 17] That\u2019s a hell of an advisory board. Image Credits: TanbiiOn its very last content slide, Tanbii drops a bomb: It\u2019s got an incredible advisory board full of people who seem pretty relevant to the company\u2019s overall mission and vision.\nI\u2019m often pretty skeptical of advisory boards, and if I were considering investing, I\u2019d pick up the phone and contact some of these folks to see how closely they are working with Tanbii. I\u2019m not saying this is the case here, but I\u2019ve often had reference calls with advisory board members who go, \u201cWait, who?\u201d and have literally no idea who the founder is or what the company does. So if you put someone on a slide, make sure they know and are prepared to receive a call out of the blue.\nA quick LinkedIn search shows that Bulteel lists being an adviser to Mi Terro, but none of the other advisers advertise their association with Tanbii. I also discovered that there were a bunch of little mistakes on this slide: \u201cDavids\u201d should be \u201cDavid\u201d and \u201cWarshauser\u201d should be \u201cWarshauer.\u201d The next step would definitely be a call or two to find out what\u2019s going on here.\nAssuming that\u2019s all in order, yes, this is a hell of an advisory board.\nI gave the founder grief for the lack of a competition slide in the previous deck. Luckily, Tanbii\u2019s deck has one!\n[Slide 13] Competitors! Image Credits: TanbiiThere\u2019s no shortage of carbon management platforms, and a good and helpful comparison between them is table stakes for a deck like this. I\u2019ll definitely give Tanbii some side-eye for using \u201cWeb5\u201d as an advantage, but I do love a good comparison chart and this one is easy to read and understand.

This included what they were like at my age, what they sounded like when they were young, or what their stories were \u2014 and that just made me incredibly sad,\u201d he continues.\n\u201cI wanted to come up with a way to preserve our families\u2019 memories at that point and I kept thinking about it over time,\u201d he says.\nThe idea simmered until later after he became a parent himself with the birth of his son in 2019 which encouraged Worley to move forward with the idea. And after the birth of his twin sons in 2021 and the loss of his mother-in-law the following year, he created a plan to launch the business to help others also preserve their digital legacies.\n\nTo use Inalife, users can sign up for free, which offers them a \u201cmemory allowance\u201d of 100MB of storage. They create their profile where they add information about themselves and add library albums filled with things like photos, videos, audio files and even documents. To add more data or create sub-accounts, users will need to upgrade to a paid subscription plan. These start at $5.99 per month for 5GB and range up to 30GB for $19.99 per month. Additional storage can also be added at a rate of $1.99 per 1GB.\nAfter setting up your account, you then connect with other family members by adding them to your family tree. Each member receives an invite and can specify how they\u2019re related. After joining, they can also browse the family tree and learn more about the other members of the family, as well as add their own albums and profile information. Sub-accounts can also be created for family members who have passed away or those who are too young to create their own profiles. (Kids can gain control of their profile through a transfer process when they\u2019re older.)\nIn addition, users can send family members messages for others to listen to at a later date.\n\u201cThe time-delayed messages are a novel way of preserving time capsule memories so loved ones can receive them at a specified date in the future,\u201d explains Worley.\nUsers can also specify someone to manage their account in case anything happens to them.\nWorley says this personal family data isn\u2019t shared with third parties and the apps are ad-free because they\u2019re paid for by subscriptions.\nWith the launch of the mobile apps planned for September 5, the founder\u2019s goal is to reach a broader market.\n\u201cWith almost 7 billion people using smartphones globally and with our most cherished photos and memories stored on them, launching the app versions of Inalife was the next stage of our plan to help bring families closer together and let them connect across generations,\u201d said Worley, in an announcement. \u201cAs we continue to increase our subscriber base, we are excited by the prospects for the company and are focused on providing customers with an authentic and valuable family experience while educating users around the world to the importance of preserving their digital legacies,\u201d he added."}, "What\u2019s the opposite of a lean startup?": {"Date": "Sep 01, 2023", "Author": "Alex Wilhelm,\u00a0\t\t\t\t\tMary Ann Azevedo,\u00a0\t\t\t\t\tTheresa Loconsolo", "Category": "AI", "Type": "This is a Free Article.", "Link": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/01/whats-the-opposite-of-a-lean-startup/", "Content": "\nListen here\u00a0or wherever you get your podcasts.\nHello and welcome back to\u00a0Equity, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.\nThis is our Friday show, and we\u2019re talking about the week\u2019s biggest startup and tech news.

The building\u2019s name refers to a year commonly associated with the Industrial Revolution. Inside you\u2019ll find a testament to automation\u2019s growing global influence, in the form of 100 autonomous robots.\u00a0\nThe robots, called\u00a0Rookies, weave in and out between people and deliver parcels, coffee and lunch to Naver\u2019s employees, all using 5G. They even have their own robots-only elevator, Roboport.\u00a0Naver Labs, the company\u2019s R&D division, launched using the new headquarters as a test bed for the Rookies. This November, it will arrange the robots in its new data center, Gak Sejong, in South Korea.\nImage Credits: Naver\nI visited the site last year, to see the robots firsthand. Rookies navigate through every inch of the headquarters, while robot arms drew pictures. Naver already owns a raft of subsidiaries, offering services like e-commerce, messaging, payments, digital comics, cloud and metaverse. And, just last week, the company launched its generative AI services\u00a0built on its large language model HyperClova X, joining the generative AI space race.\u00a0\nDoes the internet giant want to broaden robotics, artificial intelligence, and autonomous driving technology beyond its existing businesses to drive its future growth? When asked about its ongoing projects, Naver says it has been working on a handful of projects\u00a0on robots, autonomous driving technology and AI, via its R&D division since 2013. Six years ago, it acquired Xerox Research Centre Europe (XRCE) in Grenoble, France, which specializes in researching AI, machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing, to bolster its research and development. Post-acquisition, XRCE became Naver Labs.\nThe company believes people living in such innovative environments will benefit from the Naver Labs projects \u2014 including robots \u2014 in the not-too-distant future. The internet search engine wants to take part in the new kind of platform, robots, which it believes could replace mobile phones one day.\u00a0\nNaver Labs\u2018 research is aimed at five spaces: robotics (Around, Around G and Ambidex), AI (ARC System), digital twins (Alike and Hybrid HD mapping), computer vision/augmented reality (Indoor AR Navigation and Ahead) and autonomous driving technology.\u00a0\u00a0\nAt Naver\u2019s AI conference last week, TechCrunch sat down with the director of Science at Naver Labs Europe (NLE), Martin Humenberger, to learn about Naver Labs\u2019 mission and ongoing projects.\u00a0\n\u201cOur long-term vision is creating useful robots in everyday lives,\u201d Humenberger tells TechCrunch. \u201cThis includes robot assistants at home, hospitals, museums, shopping malls, airports, etc. More short-term, we focus on last-mile delivery applications in smart cities and buildings.\u201d\u00a0\nMost of its long-term projects haven\u2019t been commercialized yet. Still, its ongoing research and latest technology are continuously applied to improve the performance of Naver\u2019s robots, Rookies, at the 1784 building and the data center, Gak. In addition, it provides a robot as a service (RaaS) to the Naver Cloud\u00a0platform, Humenberger adds.\nOne example of RaaS is\u00a0the ARC system\u00a0powered by\u00a0the Naver Cloud Platform. ARC, an intelligence system for robots, enables Naver\u2019s Rookies to see, recognize and operate. ARC isn\u2019t just a control system for robots. It is the robots\u2019 eye and brain, which means Rookies don\u2019t require GPS access; instead, the ARC eye helps them recognize their surroundings, while providing the most efficient route. That\u2019s according to Vision Group leader at Naver Labs Korea, Donghwan Lee, who leads the ARC eye project. ARC Brain, meanwhile, connects service infrastructure in real time and updates data and algorithms in the cloud for robots. Rookies at the 1784 building don\u2019t need a built-in operating system thanks to their cloud connectivity that powers the ARC system, which controls the robots, Lee added. Naver says the ARC system can reduce the robot\u2019s manufacturing cost and battery consumption by moving tasks robots have to treat to the cloud.\u00a0\nImage Credits: Naver\nBoth Naver Labs in South Korea and France have some clear mutual goals, but others run in parallel, says Humenberger. The collaboration is based on information and progress sharing until they define joint objectives.\nWhile\u00a0Naver Labs Europe (NLE) focuses its research on \u201cthe fundamentals of AI and how to overcome current and future challenges in AI,\u201d Naver Labs Korea (NLK) researches and develops robotics, systems engineering\u00a0and platform engineering and operations, he adds.\nThe primary research area of NLE is the AI technology for robotics. NLE is developing \u201ccomputer vision methods for next-generation robot perception,\u201d which helps robots understand the environment better, and \u201cnew methods for sequential decision making and combinational optimization, which enables the robots to navigate in unknown environments or to perform complex manipulation tasks,\u201d Humenberger explains. NLE is also building a technology that allows efficient interaction between robots and humans via language.\nImage Credits: Naver Labs/ Martin Humenberger, director of Science at Naver Labs Europe\nTo make Naver\u2019s robots versatile assistants, NLE advances AI-powered computer vision, machine learning for robotics and natural language processes.\u00a0\n\u201cIt is true that we count a lot on AI-powered computer vision to better understand the world (semantics and geometry), reinforcement learning to teach robots to execute tasks, and natural language processing and information retrieval to make knowledge (text, images, videos, etc.) accessible to our robots,\u201d Humenberger tells TechCrunch.\nHe gives an example of a concrete research activity related to foundation models for the real world, CroCo. CroCo is a foundation model for 3D in one image. \u201cIt is designed to understand the world in 3D using images,\u201d Humenberger said, adding that it\u2019s not for generative AI or large language models but for robotics and digital twins. \u201cAt Naver Labs, we use CroCo as an advanced robot perception module for tasks such as localization, navigation, and interaction between human and robot.\u201d\n\u201cWe have a massive test bed where we can develop and operate robots in the real world, highly skilled engineers and researchers, and powerful cloud infrastructure,\u201d Humenberger explains. \u201cIt is quite difficult to secure even one of these conditions, and it is safe to say Naver is the sole company that is equipped with all of them.\u201d\nNLE has more than 100 researchers and scientists in the fields of AI, ranging from core machine learning to UX, according to Humenberger. Naver Labs did not disclose the number of staff in Korea due to confidentiality issues.\nSouth Korean tech behemoths, such as Samsung, LG, Hyundai and Doosan, are working in the pipeline of robotics development, from industrial robots to cooking, serving, and delivery robots, and\u00a0ploughing capital into the robotics space. Earlier this year,\u00a0Samsung said it plans to roll out an EX1 robot to assist elders in exercising, and its research division is developing a Samsung robot platform.

U.S. officials said Qakbot has helped to facilitate more than 40 ransomware attacks over the past 18 months alone, generating $58 million in ransom payments.\nThe law enforcement operation, named \u201cOperation Duck Hunt,\u201d saw the FBI and its international partners seize Qakbot\u2019s infrastructure located in the United States and across Europe. The U.S. Department of Justice, which ran the operation alongside the FBI, also announced the seizure of more than $8.6 million in cryptocurrency from the Qakbot cybercriminal organization, which will soon be made available to victims.\nIn Tuesday\u2019s announcement, the FBI said it carried out an operation that redirected the botnet\u2019s network traffic to servers under the U.S. government\u2019s control, allowing the feds to take control of the botnet. With this access, the FBI used the botnet to instruct Qakbot-infected machines around the world into downloading an FBI-built uninstaller that untethered the victim\u2019s computer from the botnet, preventing further installation of malware through Qakbot.\nThe FBI said its operation had identified approximately 700,000 devices infected with Qakbot as of June \u2014 including more than 200,000 located in the United States. During a call with reporters, a senior FBI official said that the total number of Qakbot victims is likely in the \u201cmillions.\u201d\nHere\u2019s how Operation Duck Hunt went down.\nAccording to the application for the operation\u2019s seizure warrant, the FBI identified and gained access to the servers running the Qakbot botnet infrastructure hosted by an unnamed web hosting company, including systems used by the Qakbot administrators. The FBI also asked the court to require the web host to secretly produce a copy of the servers to prevent the host from notifying its customers, the Qakbot administrators.\nSome of the systems the FBI got access to include the Qakbot\u2019s stack of virtual machines for testing their malware samples against popular antivirus engines, and Qakbot\u2019s servers for running phishing campaigns named after former U.S. presidents, knowing well that political-themed emails are likely to get opened. The FBI said it was also able to identify Qakbot wallets that contained crypto stolen by Qakbot\u2019s administrators.\n\u201cThrough its investigation, the FBI has gained a comprehensive understanding of the structure and function of the Qakbot botnet,\u201d the application reads, describing its plan for the botnet takedown. \u201cBased on that knowledge, the FBI has developed a means to identify infected computers, collect information from them about the infection, disconnect them from the Qakbot botnet and prevent the Qakbot administrators from further communicating with those infected computers.\u201d\nQakbot uses a network of tiered systems \u2014 described as Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 \u2014 to control the malware installed on infected computers around the world, according to the FBI and findings by U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA.\nThe FBI said that Tier 1 systems are ordinary home or business computers \u2014 many of which were located in the United States \u2014 infected with Qakbot that also have an additional \u201csupernode\u201d module, which makes them part of the botnet\u2019s international control infrastructure. Tier 1 computers communicate with Tier 2 systems, which serve as a proxy for network traffic to conceal the main Tier 3 command and control server, which the administrators use to issue encrypted commands to its hundreds of thousands of infected machines.\nWith access to these systems and with knowledge of Qakbot\u2019s encryption keys, the FBI said it could decode and understand Qakbot\u2019s encrypted commands. Using those encryption keys, the FBI was able to instruct those Tier 1 \u201csupernode\u201d computers into swapping and replacing the supernode module with a new module developed by the FBI, which had new encryption keys that would lock out the Qakbot administrators from their own infrastructure.\nAccording to an analysis of the takedown efforts from cybersecurity company Secureworks, the delivery of the FBI module began on August 25 at 7:27 p.m. in Washington, DC.\nThe FBI then sent commands instructing those Tier 1 computers to communicate instead with a server that the FBI controlled, rather than Qakbot\u2019s Tier 2 servers. From there, the next time that a Qakbot-infected computer checked in with its servers \u2014 every one to four minutes or so \u2014 it would find itself seamlessly communicating with an FBI server instead.\nAfter Qakbot-infected computers were funneled to the FBI\u2019s server, the server instructed the computer to download an uninstaller that removes the Qakbot malware altogether. (The uninstaller file was uploaded to VirusTotal, an online malware and virus scanner run by Google.) This doesn\u2019t delete or remediate any malware that Qakbot delivered, but would block and prevent another initial Qakbot infection.\nThe FBI said that its server \u201cwill be a dead end,\u201d and that it \u201cwill not capture content from the infected computers,\u201d except for the computer\u2019s IP address and associated routing information so that the FBI can contact Qakbot victims.\n\u201cThe Qakbot malicious code is being deleted from victim computers, preventing it from doing any more harm,\u201d prosecutors said Tuesday.\nThis is the most recent operational takedown the FBI has carried out in recent years.\nIn 2021, the feds carried out the first-of-its-kind operation to remove backdoors planted by Chinese hackers on hacked Microsoft Exchange email servers. A year later, the FBI disrupted a massive botnet used by Russian spies to launch powerful and disruptive cyberattacks designed to knock networks offline, and, earlier this year, knocked another Russian botnet offline that had been operating since at least 2004.\nHow the FBI goes after DDoS cyberattackers\n"}, "Google pulls popular but controversial live video chat app Chamet from the Play Store": {"Date": "Sep 01, 2023", "Author": "Ivan Mehta", "Category": "Apps", "Type": "This is a Free Article.", "Link": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/01/google-pulls-popular-but-controversial-live-video-chat-app-chamet-from-the-play-store/", "Content": "Google has removed popular but controversial live video chat app Chamet from the Play Store.

These responses have been edited for space and clarity.\nThanks very much to everyone who participated:\nWhat kinds of investment opportunities are you looking for right now?\nWe are looking for teams of uniquely qualified founders who, through their diverse experiences, cultures, identities, and training have a distinct advantage in building world-changing healthcare companies. Our sector and stage focus include digital health and techbio companies who are at seed or pre-seed stage.\nHow do you prefer to be approached: a cold email, a warm intro, or another method? \nAs an effort to break down barriers that have historically excluded far too many entrepreneurs from venture investment, we encourage entrepreneurs to reach out to us via our online submission form, without requiring a warm introduction.\nWe seem to be in a generative AI hype cycle: Where\u2019s the bar set in terms of expertise/experience with AI, and how much domain expertise do you need on the team?\nIn healthcare, you need domain expertise on the team no matter how strong you are at AI. The complexities of the stakeholders, processes, and regulations involved are too high for \u201cnormal tech disruption\u201d to work as you might see in sectors that aren\u2019t as conservative.\nFor care-delivery startups, we like to see clinicians either as part of the founding team or with a committed role as an advisor.\nIn August 2023, what are some of the top questions founders need to ask investors?\nWhat\u2019s a traditional pitch tactic that no longer works but is still a common practice?\nLess a pitch tactic, perhaps a business strategy: asking for too much money with little to no traction. The bar is higher now.\nAre you open to reviewing pitch memos, or do you prefer a completed deck?\nWe are open to reviewing any supporting documents as long as they tell your story and the business\u2019 potential well.\nTell us about the best pitch you\u2019ve received recently: At what point did you realize you were going to invest?\nA recent great pitch we saw came from a founder who was very obviously deeply knowledgeable about the problem they were solving, and the thinking behind a few different strategies they\u2019d possibly take along with their trade-offs.\nWe realized we wanted to invest when we saw the perfect combination of a founder we were highly confident in, building in a white space with lots of room to grow, and with solid paths to market that they could pivot between if needed.\nWhat are you reading/watching/listening to right now?\nFull TechCrunch+ articles are only available to members\nUse discount code TCPLUSROUNDUP to save 20% off a one- or two-year subscription\nWhat kinds of investment opportunities are you looking for right now?\nWe exclusively invest in B2B companies in Latin America. We predominantly invest in B2B companies in pre-seed stage and seed-stage companies, usually becoming the first institutional check into the business. We also invest at the Series A stage, although a little less frequently. Our typical check size for seed rounds ranges from $500,000 to $3 million USD and we like to lead or co-lead rounds.\nAs a sector-specific and thesis-driven fund, we concentrate on cloud and SaaS, e-commerce enablers, fintech, B2B marketplaces, and AI and data-driven businesses.\nHow do you prefer to be approached: a cold email, a warm intro, or another method?\nWhile we are open to cold emails, warm introductions through our network generally stand out more. It demonstrates that the founder has done their homework and has already begun networking in the industry.\nIf you\u2019re comfortable doing so, please share your contact info.\nYou can get in touch with me on Twitter @marta_cruz and for more formal interactions, our website provides a point of contact.\nWe seem to be in a generative AI hype cycle: Where\u2019s the bar set in terms of expertise/experience with AI, and how much domain expertise do you need on the team?\nFor nontechnical founders or those not primarily in the AI space, we emphasize deep domain expertise and the ability to attract and manage a solid technical team, where the ideal combined experience could include machine learning experts, data scientists, software engineers, ethics, and policy specialists.\nWe must keep in mind that AI is a collaborative effort and that diversity of knowledge often leads to more successful and innovative results. Therefore, a competent AI team must demonstrate leadership skills, a comprehensive understanding of customer needs, and a clear vision, just like in all teams of entrepreneurs, regardless of the technology they use.\nAre you open to reviewing pitch memos, or do you prefer a completed deck?\nWe are open to reviewing both pitch memos and completed decks. The key is to clearly and succinctly communicate the business\u2019s value proposition, market opportunity, roadmap for growth, and, of course, the founder team information and what the startup is looking for.\nWhat are you reading/watching/listening to right now?\nTwo books at the same time:\nWhat kinds of investment opportunities are you looking for in August 2023? \nWe have spent a significant amount of time this year understanding where startups can capture the most value and have come up with a few areas where we are excited to invest, most notably in verticalized applications of generative AI and in middleware (tooling and infrastructure) that supports the development of new AI applications.\nThese two investment theses work in concert with one another, as any company that ingests proprietary data from its verticalized application will need tooling to orchestrate and optimize this data so it can continue to create specialized workflows for its end users. We are looking forward to seeing this new trend continue to evolve.\nHow do you prefer to be approached: a cold email, a warm intro, or another method?\nWe want to speak to the best and brightest founders, regardless of whether the introduction came from someone within our network or from cold outreach. With that being said, a warm introduction can help us cut through some of the noise, as we receive dozens of pitches each day.\nIf you\u2019re comfortable doing so, please share your contact info.\ninfo@struckcapital.com\nWe seem to be in a generative AI hype cycle: Where\u2019s the bar set in terms of expertise/experience with AI, and how much domain expertise do you need on the team?\nWhile a founder with deep domain expertise through decades of working in AI and ML is certainly compelling, we don\u2019t want to exclude ourselves from working with founders earlier in their professional journey.\nWith the latter founder archetype, we would look to understand their genuine interest and depth of understanding of the technical advancements in the space.\nGenerally speaking, how much salary should the founder of a pre-revenue startup in a Tier 1 city pay themselves?\nWe typically categorize companies by funding raised, rather than by whether they are generating revenue or not, as some businesses are inherently more capital intensive than others. For the SaaS businesses that we primarily invest in, this means they will have likely raised under $2 million. We like being as data-driven as possible and will use Pave to benchmark salary recommendations.\nIn August 2023, what are some of the top questions founders need to ask investors?\nYou are increasingly starting to see more startups not able to reach their next set of milestones as quickly as they hoped, and consequently not able to raise a next round of financing. It\u2019s important for founders to understand how VCs have handled these interactions previously.\nIt\u2019s easy for a VC to be highly supportive and go the extra mile for their fastest-growing companies in their portfolio; however, what\u2019s more indicative of their future behavior is how they support companies experiencing more hardship. Look to speak with a founder in their portfolio who \u201cfailed,\u201d or ask if the VC has a strategy around continued financial support in between funding rounds.\nWhat\u2019s a traditional pitch tactic that no longer works but is still a common practice?\nWe still encounter pitches that revolve around founders preferring to present their entire pitch deck and take questions at the end. We much prefer an engaging back-and-forth discussion around specific questions we are interested in learning more about.\nA discussion results in much deeper insights from a founder, which can be extremely helpful in deciding if we want to dig into further diligence. For founders, a discussion-based approach can be more beneficial too, as it lets them understand exactly what investors want to learn more about in a more thoughtful manner. These insights can be helpful as the founder goes through their fundraising process, as they can tailor their pitches to inoculate against specific risks.\nAre you open to reviewing pitch memos, or do you prefer a completed deck?\nTypically, we prefer a completed deck, as this lets us be as prepared as possible for an introductory conversation with a founding team.\nTell us about the best pitch you\u2019ve received recently: At what point in their presentation did you realize you were going to invest?\nWe prefer to run diligence processes that stretch across a multitude of conversations, with each discussion compounding upon one another, as we and the founding team become increasingly excited about partnering.\nIt\u2019s difficult to pinpoint an exact moment, but we had the privilege of hosting the founding team of our most recent investment at our office in Santa Monica.

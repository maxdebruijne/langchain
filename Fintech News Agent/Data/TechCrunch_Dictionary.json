Gag City, the dreamy false utopia ruled by Minaj and her Barbz, broke through stan Twitter and became a viral meme that brand accounts immediately used for their own marketing \u2014 promoting Minaj\u2019s album for free.\nIs it an authentic stan-led campaign to build hype for Minaj? Is it a plant to game engagement for both the album and brands? What\u2019s clear is that the viral moment is a win for Minaj, manufactured or not.\nIt started in September, when Minaj teased the album\u2019s cover art online. The image features Minaj on a pink subway car, drifting through pink clouds with a futuristic (and obviously, pink) city skyline in the background.\n11.17.23 #PinkFriday2 \ud83c\udf80 pic.twitter.com/Tm9ugiGAlH\n\u2014 Nicki Minaj (@NICKIMINAJ) September 5, 2023\n\nShe and her Barbz started referring to the album\u2019s release as \u201cGag City,\u201d NBC News reports, referencing gay slang for being so amazed that you\u2019re at a loss for words. One might be gagged by witnessing a stunning outfit change, or by listening to a perfect record, like \u201cPink Friday 2.\u201d Leading up to the release, stans started posted AI-generated images of a pink concrete jungle, joking that fictional characters and celebrities were arriving to Gag City in anticipation of Minaj\u2019s album. In one of the first, posted on Dec. 1 according to Know Your Meme, a fan account shared an image of a pink plane labeled \u201cGagg City\u201d flying over a similarly pink skyline.\nIn the days before the release, Minaj told fans to \u201cprepare for landing\u201d and teased a description of her pink utopia.

One posted an image of Barbz storming the Pink House, which another user described as the fandom\u2019s own January 6th. Another posted an image of pink-clad citizens protesting in the streets of Gag City, calling for Minaj to release the album\u2019s track list. Though some may believe that Gag City is a utopia, one account posted an image of a matronly Minaj handing out CDs of her album to impoverished children \u201con the outskirts of Gag City,\u201d implying that the pink society also has a class divide problem.\nGag City is also riddled with stan wars, as fans of rival pop stars posted images of their faves vying for Minaj\u2019s seat at the head of her city\u2019s government. In a nod to Greek mythology, one account posted an image of a Trojan horse decorated in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cRenaissance\u201d disco motif.\n\ud83d\udea8 BREAKING: The Barbz have discovered a mysterious, metallic horse at the front gates of Gag City. \nAn inscription reads \u201cFor their return home, the Hive dedicate this offering to Onika.\u201d pic.twitter.com/64SKkWuGoc\n\u2014 uncle gworl (@_uncle_gworl) December 8, 2023\n\nnicki minaj addresses the citizens of gag city prior to the inauguration tonight pic.twitter.com/sfC964ly7o\n\u2014 Xeno\ud83d\udc7e (@AClDBLEEDER) December 7, 2023\n\nNever one to miss out on an easy trend, brand accounts started joining in on the Gag City hype.

AI-generated images are already ethically fraught, and critics have raised concerns over AI generators trained on artwork without the consent of the work\u2019s artists. Artists have also criticized brands for using AI-generated art instead of commissioning work from a real, human artist. Though using AI-generated art for commercial use is legal, as copyright laws pertaining to AI are virtually non-existent, it\u2019s generally seen as a shitty move by many in the art world.\nOn the other, it\u2019s free promotion for Minaj, and as a lifelong Barb who spent her adolescence running a stan account for \u201cPink Friday,\u201d I consider it a win.\nNicki Minaj is an artist who\u2019s been embroiled in controversy throughout her career, from posting bad takes about Covid vaccines to defending her husband Kenneth Petty, a convicted sex offender. She may be a brilliant artist, but her problematic history makes her far from the family-friendly public figure that brands are more likely to endorse.\nBut with Gag City, Minaj has brands doing all of her marketing for her. \u201cPink Friday 2\u201d is an artistic marvel in itself (though I am probably biased), but the free promotion that it\u2019s been getting as a viral meme is particularly astounding. Artists have spent the last few years trying to drum up engagement for their work by making their songs trend on TikTok, which audiences have started to resist. Gag City doesn\u2019t bank on being the viral song of the summer to drive streaming numbers \u2014 the bit is removed enough for non-stans to enjoy it, while still revolving around the album it\u2019s promoting.\nBrand Twitter tends to turn fun trends into advertising opportunities, taking organic community interactions and spitting out contrived versions clearly made to go viral. It may be grating, but in this case, it\u2019s working in Minaj\u2019s favor. This week, everyone wants to go to Gag City."}, "EU lawmakers bag late night deal on \u2018global first\u2019 AI rules": {"Date": "Dec 08, 2023", "Author": "Natasha Lomas", "Category": "AI", "Type": "This is a Free Article.", "Link": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/08/eu-ai-act-political-deal/", "Content": "After marathon \u2018final\u2019 talks which stretched to almost three days European Union lawmakers have tonight clinched a political deal on a risk-based framework for regulating artificial intelligence. The file was originally proposed back in April 2021 but it\u2019s taken months of tricky three-way negotiations to get a deal over the line. The development means a pan-EU AI law is definitively on the way.\nGiving a triumphant but exhausted press conference in the small hours of Friday night/Saturday morning local time key representatives for the European Parliament, Council and the Commission \u2014 the bloc\u2019s co-legislators \u2014 hailed the agreement as hard fought, a milestone achievement and historic, respectively.\nTaking to X to tweet the news, the EU\u2019s president, Ursula von der Leyen \u2014 who made delivering an AI law a key priority of her term when she took up the post in late 2019 \u2014 also lauded the political agreement as a \u201cglobal first\u201d.\nThe \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa AI Act is a global first. \nA unique legal framework for the development of AI you can trust.\nAnd for the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses.\nA commitment we took in our political guidelines \u2013 and we delivered.\nI welcome today's political agreement.\n\u2014 Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) December 8, 2023\n\nFull details of what\u2019s been agreed won\u2019t be entirely confirmed until a final text is compiled and made public, which may take some weeks. But a press release put out by the European Parliament confirms the deal reached with the Council includes a total prohibition on the use of AI for:\nThe use of remote biometric identification technology in public places by law enforcement has not been completely banned \u2014 but the parliament said negotiators had agreed on a series of safeguards and narrow exceptions to limit use of technologies such as facial recognition. This includes a requirement for prior judicial authorisation \u2014 and with uses limited to a \u201cstrictly defined\u201d lists of crime.\nRetrospective (non-real-time) use of remote biometric ID AIs will be limited to \u201cthe targeted search of a person convicted or suspected of having committed a serious crime\u201d. While real-time use of this intrusive AI tech will be limited in time and location, and can only be used for the following purposes:\nThe package agreed also includes obligations for AI systems that are classified as \u201chigh risk\u201d owing to having \u201csignificant potential harm to health, safety, fundamental rights, environment, democracy and the rule of law\u201d.\n\u201cMEPs successfully managed to include a mandatory fundamental rights impact assessment, among other requirements, applicable also to the insurance and banking sectors. AI systems used to influence the outcome of elections and voter behaviour, are also classified as high-risk,\u201d the parliament wrote. \u201cCitizens will have a right to launch complaints about AI systems and receive explanations about decisions based on high-risk AI systems that impact their rights.\u201d\nThere was also agreement on a \u201ctwo-tier\u201d system of guardrails to be applied to \u201cgeneral\u201d AI systems, such as the so-called foundational models underpinning the viral boom in generative AI applications like ChatGPT.\nAs we reported earlier\u00a0the deal reached on foundational models/general purpose AIs (GPAIs) includes some transparency requirements for what co-legislators referred to as \u201clow tier\u201d AIs \u2014 meaning model makers must draw up technical documentation and produce (and publish) detailed summaries about the content used for training in order to support compliance with EU copyright law.\nThe Commission has been working with industry on a stop-gap AI Pact for some months \u2014 and it confirmed today this is intended to plug the practice gap until the AI Act comes into force.\nWhile foundational models/GPAIs that have been commercialized face regulation under the Act, R&D is not intended to be in scope of the law \u2014 and fully open sourced models will have lighter regulatory requirements than closed source, per today\u2019s pronouncements.\nThe package agreed also promotes regulatory sandboxes and real-world-testing being established by national authorities to support startups and SMEs to develop and train AIs before placement on the market.\nPenalties for non-compliance can lead to fines ranging from \u20ac35 million or 7% of global turnover to \u20ac7.5 million or 1.5 % of turnover, depending on the infringement and size of the company.\nThe deal agreed today also allows for a phased entry into force after the law is adopted \u2014 with six months allowed until rules on prohibited use cases kick in; 12 months for transparency and governance requirements; and 24 months for all other requirements. So the full force of the EU\u2019s AI Act may not be felt until 2026.\nCarme Artigas, Spain\u2019s secretary of state for digital and AI issues, who led the Council\u2019s negotiations on the file as the country has held the rotating Council presidency since the summer, hailed the agreement on the heavily contested file as \u201cthe biggest milestone in the history of digital information in Europe\u201d; both for the bloc\u2019s single digital market \u2014 but also, she suggested, \u201cfor the world\u201d.\n\u201cWe have achieved the first international regulation for artificial intelligence in the world,\u201d she announced during a post-midnight press conference to confirm the political agreement, adding: \u201cWe feel very proud.\u201d\nThe law will support European developers, startups and future scale-ups by giving them \u201clegal certainty with technical certainty\u201d, she predicted.\nSpeaking on behalf of the European Parliament, co-rapporteurs Drago\u0219 Tudorache and Brando Benifei said their objective had been to deliver AI legislation that would ensure the ecosystem developed with a \u201chuman centric approach\u201d which respects fundamental rights and European values. Their assessment of the outcome was equally upbeat \u2014 citing the inclusion in the agreed text of a total ban on the use of AI for predictive policing and for biometric categorization as major wins.\n\u201cFinally we got in the right track, defending fundamental rights to the necessity that is there for our democracies to endure such incredible changes,\u201d said Benifei. \u201cWe are the first ones in the world to have a horizontal legislation that has this direction on fundamental rights, that supports the development of AI in our continent, and that is up to date to the frontier of the artificial intelligence with the most powerful models under clear obligation. So I think we delivered.\u201d\n\u201cWe have always been questioned whether there is enough protection, whether there is enough stimulant for innovation in this text, and I can say, this balance is there,\u201d added Tudorache. \u201cWe have safeguards, we have all the provisions that we need, the redress that we need in giving trust to our citizens in the interaction with AI, in the products in the services that they will interact with from now on.\n\u201cWe now have to use this blueprint to seek now global convergence because this is a global challenge for everyone. And I think that with the work that we\u2019ve done, as difficult as it was \u2014 and it was difficult, this was a marathon negotiation by all standards, looking at all precedents so far \u2014 but I think we delivered.\u201d\nThe EU\u2019s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, also chipped in with his two euro-cents \u2014 describing the agreement clinched a little before midnight Brussels\u2019 time as \u201chistoric\u201d. \u201cIt is a full package. It is a complete deal. And this is why we spent so much time,\u201d he intoned. \u201cThis is balancing user safety, innovation for startups, while also respecting\u2026 our fundamental rights and our European values.\u201d\nDespite the EU very visibly patting itself on the back tonight on securing a deal on \u2018world-first\u2019 AI rules, it\u2019s not quite yet the end of the road for the bloc\u2019s lawmaking process as there are still some formal steps to go \u2014 not least the final text will face votes in the parliament and the Council to adopt it. But given how much division and disagreement there has been over how (or even whether) to regulate AI the biggest obstacles have been dismantled with this political deal and the path to passing the EU AI Act in the coming months looks clear.\nThe Commission is certainly projecting confidence. Per Breton, work to implement the agreement starts immediately with the set up of an AI Office within the EU\u2019s executive \u2014 which will have the job of coordinating with the Member State oversight bodies that will need to enforce the rules on AI firms. \u201cWe will welcome new colleagues\u2026 a lot of them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will work \u2014 starting tomorrow \u2014 to get ready.\u201d\nEU \u2018final\u2019 talks to fix AI rules to run into second day \u2014 but deal on foundational models is on the table\n\nEurope\u2019s AI Act talks head for crunch point\n"}, "Report: FAA should improve investigation process after a rocket launch goes awry": {"Date": "Dec 08, 2023", "Author": "Aria Alamalhodaei", "Category": "Space", "Type": "This is a Free Article.", "Link": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/08/report-faa-should-improve-investigation-process-after-a-rocket-launch-goes-awry/", "Content": "The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has let launch providers conduct their own investigations in nearly every instance that a launch mishap has occurred since the start of the century \u2014 a practice that needs closer scrutiny, a federal watchdog said in a new report.\nThe report, published Thursday by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), takes a close look at the investigations into launch mishaps, the industry term for when a launch ends in an explosion or other failure. Mishap investigations are a normal course of action and are generally under the aegis of the FAA \u2014 but this report reveals that the practice is basically entirely operator-led, with the FAA having inadequate resources for in-house investigations.\nOf the 49 mishaps that occurred between 2000 and 2023, and for which FAA was the lead investigative authority, all were led by the launch operator, the report found. The one exception was an investigation into a fatal accident involving SpaceShipTwo in October 2014, for which the National Transportation Safety Board was the lead authority.\nThe FAA lets the launch company lead its own investigations for a number of reasons, officials told GAO. A close understanding of vehicle design and the underlying technology is necessary when undertaking a root cause investigation into a failure, and the operators know their vehicle best. FAA officials also estimated that in-house investigations would take 10-20 times longer than those led by the operator.\nThe U.S. Government Accountability Office said the FAA should develop criteria for determining when a mishap investigation is led by its office or the launch provider, the report said. It further found that the FAA has not evaluated the effectiveness of its \u201coperator-reliant\u201d mishap investigation process.\n\u201cFAA officials told us they make their decisions to authorize operator-led investigations depending on the level of investigation required, which is largely based on severity of the mishap or its consequences and may also take into consideration the level of public interest,\u201d the report said. \u201cHowever, in practice, FAA authorized the operator involved to lead the investigation of its mishap for all 49 mishaps for which FAA had lead investigative authority.\u201d\nEven when investigations are led by the launch company, the FAA still exercises some degree of oversight and involvement in the process. But some stakeholders questioned whether the launch companies \u201ccan be impartial or effective investigators of their own mishaps.\u201d\nLaunch providers told the GAO that they take steps to maintain independence of their internal investigations, and others said that market incentives and insurance requirements can also create positive incentives for a rigorous, credible investigation process.\nRegardless, GAO found that the FAA did not maintain criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of operator-led investigations, and has no formal channels for operators to share their findings with the wider industry.\n\u201cWithout a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of its operator-led mishap investigation process, FAA cannot be assured that its safety oversight is best achieving agency objectives in an area of critical importance,\u201d GAO said."}, "Apple cuts off Beeper Mini\u2019s access after launch of service that brought iMessage to Android": {"Date": "Dec 08, 2023", "Author": "Sarah Perez", "Category": "Apps", "Type": "This is a Free Article.", "Link": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/08/apple-cuts-off-beeper-minis-access-after-launch-of-service-that-brought-imessage-to-android/", "Content": "Was it too good to be true? Beeper, the startup that reverse-engineered iMessage to bring blue bubble texts to Android users, is experiencing an outage, the company reported via a post on X on Friday. And Apple is to blame, it seems. Users, including those of us at TechCrunch with access to the app, began seeing error messages when trying to send texts via the newly released Beeper Mini and messages are not going through.\nThe error message reads: \u201cfailed to lookup on server: lookup request timed out\u201d spelled out in red letters.\nImage Credits: screenshot of Beeper Mini error\nIn a response to a question on Reddit as to whether or not the app was broken, a Beeper team member had earlier replied, \u201cReport a problem from the app, give us a chance to look into it.\u201d\nHowever, Beeper CEO\u00a0Eric Migicovsky responded to TechCrunch\u2019s inquiry about Beeper Mini\u2019s status by pointing us to the X post acknowledging the outage, and providing more detail. Asked if possibly Apple found a way to cut off Beeper Mini\u2019s ability to function, he replied, \u201cYes, all data indicates that.\u201d\nInvestigating reports that sending/receiving is not working in Beeper Mini \ud83d\udd0e\n\u2014 Beeper (@onbeeper) December 8, 2023\n\nWe don\u2019t know what this means for the future of Beeper Mini\u2019s efforts, unless Beeper\u2019s engineers are able to work around the problem somehow.\nMigicovsky, who previously founded the smartwatch Pebble, has argued that Beeper Mini wasn\u2019t just beneficial for Android users who wanted to finally join their iMessage friends\u2019 group chats, but that it increased security for iPhone users, too.\nIn an interview ahead of Beeper Mini\u2019s launch, the founder explained that green bubble texts were unencrypted.\n\u201cThat means that anytime you text your Android friends, anyone can read the message. Apple can read the message. Your phone carrier can read the message. Google\u2026 literally, it\u2019s just like a postcard. Anyone can read it. So Beeper Mini actually increases the security of iPhones,\u201d he had told TechCrunch.\nApple, on the other hand, sees iMessage as one of the key tools for locking in users to its ecosystem, which is why it won\u2019t launch an iMessage app for Android. While there was some hope that EU regulations would force it to make iMessage more interoperable, news this week indicates that iMessage will get a reprieve from those rules because the service is not popular enough with business users. That means Apple has no reason not to try to shut down Beeper Mini, if it could.\nMigicovsky is none too pleased with that turn of events.\n\u201cI would be very interested to hear why they think that making security worse for iPhone users makes sense,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s Apple, then I think the biggest question is \u2014 if Apple truly cares about the privacy and security of their own iPhone users, why would they try to kill a service that enables iPhones to send encrypted chats to Android users? With their announcement of RCS support, it\u2019s clear that Apple knows they have a gaping hole here. Beeper Mini is here today and works great. Why force iPhone users back to sending unencrypted SMS when they chat with friends on Android?,\u201d he asked.\nFounded in 2020, Beeper\u2019s team had originally been working on a multi-platform messaging aggregator, which was renamed Beeper Cloud this week as Beeper Mini went to launch. The latter uses new technology that allows Android users to text iMessage users as if they were also texting from an iPhone for just $1.99 per month. That means blue bubbles in the group chat, not green ones. Because the startup was no longer using a middleman \u2014 like a Mac server relaying messages, as other iMessage-to-Android apps employ \u2014 it would essentially appear to Apple\u2019s servers that Beeper Mini\u2019s messages were coming from a device that runs iMessage natively. It\u2019s unclear, then, how Apple was able to cut off Beeper Mini\u2019s access.\nWhat this means for Beeper Mini\u2019s future is uncertain.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll evaluate options,\u201d Migicovsky said.\nUpdate, maybe?\nStay close to your phones https://t.co/WjwNRvkzW5\n\u2014 Eric Migicovsky (@ericmigi) December 9, 2023\n \nBeeper reverse-engineered iMessage to bring blue bubble texts to Android users\n"}, "Will December bring startup winter?": {"Date": "Dec 08, 2023", "Author": "Haje Jan Kamps", "Category": "Startups", "Type": "This is a Free Article.", "Link": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/08/will-december-bring-startup-winter/", "Content": "Welcome to Startups Weekly.

Forget about marveling at the wonder that is flying; going through an airport is still very much a hassle, and this is where Atlanta-based startup Travelsist can help.\nThere are several sides to what the company does, including an AI-enabled chatbot called VERA. But \u201cat the simplest level,\u201d its team told me, \u201cthe Travelsist platform connects travelers who need help getting through the airport with a Travelsistant who provides concierge and personal assistant services that help get them from their ride to plane-side safely and on time.\u201d\nFounded by former flight attendant Veronica Woodruff, the startup was a Startup Battlefield company at TechCrunch Disrupt earlier this year. At the time, I highlighted how it was part of a growing group of startups that make life easier for disabled individuals; but there are many more people that Travelsist can help, including working moms like Woodruff.\n\u201cI arrived at the airport one day for a cross-country flight, and realized I\u2019d left my daughter\u2019s stroller at home,\u201d she recalled.\nFrom parents to seniors to first-time fliers, there are many who could use a hand, and there is more than wheelchair or stroller services that can make airports more accessible; which is why Travelsist also provides passengers \u201chelp with wayfinding, or other physical or navigational support in what is oftentimes a very stressful and chaotic portion of their trip.\u201d\nWhile Travelsist\u2019s end users are the passengers, the startup\u2019s customers are airports and airlines (except for a few exceptions where passengers can request assistance and pay for it themselves).\nGoing B2B2C make sense: These have a legal obligation to assist people with disabilities, for instance, but it often proves expensive and tricky, which is why they are willing to outsource it to a third party like Travelsist.\nTravelsist doesn\u2019t simply find people who can provide assistance; it also leverages technology to make the whole process more efficient. For instance, the platform reduces waiting time for assistance by locating where it is required, Woodruff told me.\nWhile the company received international interest, the U.S. was its initial focus, starting with Atlanta \u2014 and not just Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL). Travelsist is now able to assist passengers flying in and out of the two biggest airports in its hometown. Since Disrupt, it closed a partnership with DeKalb-Peachtree Airport (PDK), which Woodruff described to me as \u201ca popular regional Atlanta-area airport that services lots of private flights and VIP travelers.\u201d\nIt is a natural evolution for Travelsist to expand its audience, and it already has. Since its inception four years ago and subsequent launch in 2020, the company wrote in a document which head of product Dino Decespedes shared with me, \u201cTravelsist\u2019s value proposition has evolved from babygear rental for moms who travel, to an enterprise software solution solving human capital headaches for the world\u2019s busiest airports and airliners.\u201d\nTalking to Woodruff in person, the human element mentioned above comes across much more clearly, and it becomes clear how she is passionate not only about helping travelers, but also providing Travelsistants with fulfilling and potentially life-changing work opportunities.\n\u201cWhat I love most about being able to offer people the opportunity to work at a company that\u2019s at the airport is that they have an opportunity to meet someone that\u2019s beyond their front door. There\u2019s so many people that come from so many different walks of life, that you never know how a 10-minute conversation can influence or change your life; that person can be someone that can offer you an even better job than Travelsist,\u201d Woodruff said.\nIn the meantime, Travelsist is intentional about making sure that these 1099 workers \u201cknow that they\u2019re valued and that they\u2019re appreciated,\u201d and enjoy good working conditions. \u201cWe pride ourselves in being a tech company first, but the number one thing is that we\u2019re bringing in a new culture to this industry, where people can have more control over their time, earn good wages and be trained with [new] skills.\u201d\nTravelsist\u2019s employee app is there to support these workers by filling them in with specific details around a traveler\u2019s request and location, but also providing them with training and reminders. For example, making sure a passenger is properly buckled up before you lift them, and asking nicely for permission \u2014 a welcome change, considering that flying with a disability too often ends up being dehumanizing.\nIf the company ever runs out of Travelsistants, it can count on My PANDA, a fellow Atlanta-based startup (PANDA stands for Personal Assistants Next Door). It\u2019s run by a really good friend of hers, Woodruff said. \u201cWe have an agreement where I can dip into her staff: If I need them, they come and work for us. Atlanta is a beautiful place to build because of those relationships.\u201d\nAtlanta investors are bullish on where the city\u2019s startup scene is headed\n\nBesides its core team and its Travelsistants, Travelsist also has some 25 contractors and \u201ca lot of people who advise us and meet with us.\u201d The company was part of the first women-focused cohort of the Techstars Founder Catalyst Program based in Atlanta and conducted in partnership with J.P. Morgan; it also received support and awards from several other organizations. This is part of being from Atlanta, Woodruff beamed. \u201cAtlanta is a very hands-on city when you\u2019re building something that people believe in; people want us to succeed.\u201d\nBeyond Atlanta, the company was flying relatively under the radar until recently, when it obtained some provisional patents that made the team more confident about its odds against competitors.\nAI is part of its strategy: At TechCrunch Disrupt, it launched VERA, a chatbot that can answer traveler questions \u201caround flight times, airport shops and restaurants, security line wait times, parking instructions, airport and TSA rules, hours of operation, and much much more,\u201d the team wrote to me.\nImage Credits: Travelsist\nFor airports and airlines, the chatbot is another opportunity to improve traveler satisfaction, which they can track alongside other metrics in the customized data dashboard that Travelsist provides.\nThis value proposition seems to be resonating. \u201cWe are on track to close 12-15 new airports in the first half of 2024, which would allow us to service more travelers end-to-end \u2014 in their departure airport AND their arrival airport,\u201d Woodruff messaged me.\nTravelsist already has some raised some $850,000 funding to execute its plans, including investment from The Fearless Fund and a grant from the Black ParentPreneur Foundation. But it is understandably seeking more, and currently is raising a $5 million Series A round it hopes to close by the end of the year. This would be timely, as travel woes will be on many minds at this time of the year.\nDisability tech startups kill the cynic in me\n"}, "DNA companies should receive the death penalty for getting hacked": {"Date": "Dec 08, 2023", "Author": "Haje Jan Kamps", "Category": "Startups", "Type": "This is a Free Article.", "Link": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/08/protect-or-perish/", "Content": "Personal data is the new gold. The recent 23andMe data breach is a stark reminder of a chilling reality \u2014 our most intimate, personal information might not be as secure as we think. It\u2019s a damning indictment of the sheer negligence of companies that, while profiting from our DNA, are failing to protect it.\nThe 23andMe breach saw hackers gaining access to a whopping 6.9 million users\u2019 personal information, including family trees, birth years and geographic locations. It brings to the fore a few significant questions: Are companies really doing enough to protect our data? Should we trust them with our most intimate information?\n23andMe confirms hackers stole ancestry data on 6.9 million users\n\nCompanies are promising to keep our data safe, but there are a couple of quirks here. Government overreach is certainly a possibility, as the FBI and every policing agency in the world is probably salivating at the thought of getting access to such a huge dataset of DNA sequences. It could be a gold mine for every cold case from here to the South Pole.\nThe argument, \u201cBut if you haven\u2019t done something wrong, you have nothing to worry about!\u201d is only partially applicable, here: The problem is one of consent. My father at one point did a DNA test, and discovered he had a half-brother who is about to turn 80. Cue an incredible amount of family drama when they started digging into the history and unearthed a whole bunch of potentially problematic family history.\nThe problem isn\u2019t so much that my dad chose to do that, it is that I didn\u2019t consent to being in a database, and that\u2019s where things get sticky. I can envision a definite Black Mirror-esque future, where one family member is curious about their ancestry, gets tested, and two weeks later, the FBI comes knocking on every person\u2019s door who shares 50% DNA with that person because they are wanted for some sort of crime.\nThe audacity of 23andMe, and companies like it, is astounding. They pitch themselves as guardians of our genetic history, as the gatekeepers of our ancestral pasts and potential medical futures. But when the chips are down and our data is leaked, they hide behind the old \u201cwe were not hacked; it was the users\u2019 old passwords\u201d excuse.\nThis logic is equivalent to a bank saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not our fault your money got stolen; you should have had a better lock on your front door.\u201d It\u2019s unacceptable and a gross abdication of responsibility.\nCompanies that deal with such sensitive data should be held to the highest possible standard. We\u2019re not just talking about credit card numbers or email addresses here. This is our DNA, the very blueprint of our existence. If anything should be considered \u201csacred\u201d in the digital realm, surely it should be this?\nThe fact that the stolen data was advertised as a list of people with ancestries that have, in the past, been victims of systemic discrimination, adds another disturbing layer to this debacle. It highlights the potential for such data to be misused in the most nefarious ways, including targeted attacks and discrimination.\n23andMe says hackers accessed \u2018significant number\u2019 of files about users\u2019 ancestry\n\nThe DNA testing industry needs to step up. It must ensure that the security measures in place are not just adequate, but exceptional. They should be leading the charge in cybersecurity, setting an example for all other industries to follow.\nThis is not just about better passwords or two-factor authentication. This is about a fundamental shift in how these companies view the data they are entrusted with. It\u2019s about recognizing the profound responsibility they have, not just to their customers, but to society at large.\nAm I hopeful? Not even a little. I\u2019ve long argued that after the Equifax breach, the company should have received the corporate equivalent of the death penalty. Instead, it was given a $700 million fine. I think that\u2019s laughable. Allowing a breach of such a magnitude to even be possible, never mind actually come to pass? You don\u2019t deserve to continue to be a company. I think that is even truer for companies dealing with our DNA.\nIt\u2019s time for 23andMe and the DNA testing industry as a whole to realize that they are not just dealing with data. They are dealing with people\u2019s lives, their histories and their futures. It\u2019s time they started treating our data with the respect and care it deserves."}, "Fundraising trends for 2024: Get to the point, explain \u2018why now\u2019": {"Date": "Dec 08, 2023", "Author": "Haje Jan Kamps", "Category": "Fundraising", "Type": "This is a Premium Article, and therefore only displays the first part of the article.", "Link": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/08/fundraising-in-2024/", "Content": "\nThanksgiving is long behind us, so unless you\u2019re already in due diligence with a VC, you may as well pack up your fundraising knapsack and chill out until the holidays are over.\nBut this is an opportunity, too. The quiet weeks ahead are the perfect time to polish your pitch deck and perfect your pitch before kicking things back off in January.\nAccording to a new report on the early-stage fundraising trends of 2023 by DocSend, things are pretty bleak for young startups. At the seed stage, founders have had to contact more investors but ended up with fewer meetings, pointing to an increasingly competitive fundraising environment.\nThe report shows a correlation between the number of investors contacted and both the number of meetings held and the amount of funding raised. Many seed-stage startups in the dataset managed to secure a significant number of meetings, and consequently, raised capital, by reaching out to fewer than 50 investors. In contrast, founders who contacted more than 80 investors were a lot less successful.\nThere may be some noise in the data, however: AI\u2019s popularity and availability has made it easier for founders to reach out to a lot of VCs (anecdotally, that seems to be what the VCs are observing as well).

In the hours that I know I should be sleeping, I am hounded by content of petite dogs proclaiming that they\u2019re soilpilled, or mulchmaxxing, or delighting in eating mulch with fellow sisters of the loam. The mulchgang prays for a plentiful harvest. Mulch posts celebrate a body nourished by microplastics and synthetic food dye. The silty clay earth feeds us all.\u00a0\nBefore the inevitable moral panic sets in once the trend gains enough mainstream attention: Mulch posts are not encouraging children to ingest dirt. Mulch memes are just that \u2014 silly posts that, like the absurd, post-ironic internet humor that has been popular for years, aren\u2019t that deep. The trend\u2019s earnestness provides a brief reprieve from the fatalist cynicism that tends to drive meme culture.\u00a0\nThe meme came from, of all places, Instagram Reels. The spread of mulch posts across TikTok shows that Instagram still has influence in driving internet culture, despite Reels\u2019 rocky start. It\u2019s one of the first original Reels content to go viral beyond Instagram.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMulchposting started with a post in May from Instagram meme account sme11a__, which featured the word \u201cmulch\u201d superimposed on a low-res image of a white dog. The post was captioned, \u201cmulch is here #mulchgang.\u201d The post itself wasn\u2019t particularly viral; in the last six months, it\u2019s gained about 10,000 likes. The meme didn\u2019t go viral until sme11a__ posted a Reel referencing the meme a month later, Know Your Meme reports, which gained over 103,000 likes. Other meme accounts started posting similar content \u2014 in a post of a comically fluffy dog with the text \u201csandy clay loam,\u201d the meme account qooslag even credited sme11a__ for starting the trend.\u00a0\n\nA post shared by Mulch gang (@sme11a__)\n\n\nA post shared by Mulch gang (@sme11a__)\n\nSme11a__, whose Instagram bio says they don\u2019t have a TikTok account, continued posting mulch Reels throughout the summer. The videos typically featured supercuts of fluffy white dogs over audio about mulch. In September, they posted a Reel using an AI-generated childish voice that said, \u201cI love mulch. Mulch is my favorite food.\u201d\nOthers started reposting sme11a__\u2019s Reel, which had over 195,000 likes on Instagram, to TikTok that month. The meme, which had been largely contained to Instagram, began taking off on the competing platform. On TikTok, the tag #mulchgang has over 49 million views, and tag #mulchmaxxing has over 20 million views. TikToks about the meme\u2019s apparent obscurity and bizarre premise further propelled its popularity.\u00a0\nUnder a video about struggling to explain the meme to those who aren\u2019t chronically online, TikTok user bisouchuu commented, \u201ci am mulchmaxxing on microplastic 24/7 but i keep mentioning it to my non soilpilled friends.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThis message makes me feel like a Victorian child when I read it,\u201d another user replied to bisouchuu.\u00a0\nRIP to my fellow members of #mulchgang lmao #mulch #mulchgangforlife #mulchfairy #fyp \n \u266c original sound \u2013 banjax \n \nSome have questioned whether mulch posts could be dogwhistles for hate groups. It\u2019s understandable that viewers would be suspicious of coded language in memes, given the history of white supremacy groups adopting seemingly innocuous imagery as symbols of their ideology. The white nationalist campaign to claim Pepe the Frog as the face of racist extremism jaded us all against anything online that should be wholesome. An Instagram user asked sme11a__ to reassure them that mulch gang isn\u2019t a \u201cn@z1\u201d or \u201cNFT cult\u201d in the comments of a recent Reel.\n\u201cim not any of those things, mulch gang is just funny dogs eat dirt,\u201d sme11a__ replied.\nMulchposting has all the markers of meme humor mischaracterized as \u201cGen Z culture,\u201d which is really just Very Online humor. It\u2019s absurd, and it\u2019s easy to replicate, and there\u2019s space for the joke to evolve. Internet absurdism is cyclical in nature, and mulch posts have been preceded by years of shitposting.\nIn 2017, The Washington Post tried to explain internet humor in a column titled, \u201cWhy is millennial humor so weird?\u201d The column cited the meme \u201cHey Beter,\u201d a four-panel image that starts with someone addressing the \u201cFamily Guy\u201d character Peter Griffin as \u201cBeter,\u201d and ends with a phrase completely unrelated to the first image. In the example cited by The Washington Post, a laser-eyed Elmo holds Peter at gunpoint and demands that he spell \u201cWhomst\u2019ve.\u201d The meme ends by asking viewers to \u201cfollow for a free iphone 5.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nIn its recent explanation of Gen Z humor for bewildered millennials, Insider cited the Grimace shake trend that went viral on TikTok earlier this year. In Grimace shake videos, TikTok users filmed themselves taking sips of McDonald\u2019s purple milkshake, before the video abruptly cut to a clip of the same user incapacitated on the ground, in abandoned buildings or in eerily empty playgrounds.\u00a0\nNeither \u201cHey Beter\u201d nor the Grimace shake trend have an explicit punchline. The non sequitur is the punchline. Absurdist philosophy pervades meme humor, and the futility of trying to explain jokes that are ultimately meaningless is what makes internet absurdism so funny. It\u2019s fitting that the meme \u201cOne Must Imagine Sisyphus Happy,\u201d which went viral on Instagram and TikTok this year when users paired the phrase with images and videos of impossible tasks, is pulled from an essay by philosopher and absurdist writer Albert Camus.\n\u201cone imagine sisyphus is happy\u201d #jpegmafia #the_bitter_sweet_deluxe #fart #groundgeef #kanyewest \n \u266c femboys r hot \u2013 \ud83d\udcbf\ud83d\udcc0 \n \nInternet culture is constantly subverting itself, and the \u201cGen Z humor\u201d shaping memes today, like mulch posts, is an evolution of \u201cmillennial humor\u201d of the 2010s. With its motivational undertones and earnest nature, the version of internet humor that exists today is decidedly less bleak than its millennial predecessor, which the Guardian described as \u201cdisorientating, dark and strange\u201d in 2019. That millennial humor was shaped by online trends that existed long before social media. The 1998 \u201cHampster Dance,\u201d credited as one of the first internet memes, was infectious, nonsensical and at the time, inexplicably funny.\nThe trajectory of mulch posts, from Instagram to TikTok instead of the other way around, is uncommon, but given the enduring popularity of absurdist memes, it makes sense that shitpost-y content would be one of the first original Instagram trends to break through to mainstream social media in years. Screenshots of Instagram posts, most of which are from meme accounts, are constantly reposted as TikTok slideshows \u2014 though the recycled content consists of standalone memes, and haven\u2019t inspired a larger trend under a unifying theme. Reels may have had original trends, like viral songs or popular editing techniques, but few, if any, have been unique enough to spread to other platforms.\u00a0\nInstagram\u2019s hold on internet culture slipped as TikTok usage became more ubiquitous in recent years, and TikTok users have derided Instagram users as millennials who are behind on meme trends. Instagram\u2019s short-form video feature, Reels, was built to rival TikTok, but the platform\u2019s early years have been dominated by recycled TikToks. Instagram has tried to discourage users from reposting TikToks by refusing to recommend posts that contain TikTok\u2019s watermark. An internal Meta document from August 2022 noted that nearly a third of Reels content was originally posted elsewhere, The Wall Street Journal reported.\u00a0\nLacking original content and overrun with reposts, Reels has been perceived as a platform for out-of-touch millennials \u2014 a sentiment jokingly held by many on TikTok. More Gen Z adults use Instagram than TikTok, according to surveys conducted by the data analysis company Morning Consult for its semiannual report on media and entertainment, and more Gen Z adults use both platforms at least once a day than millennials. It isn\u2019t a generational divide that\u2019s fueling the negative perception of Reels, it\u2019s the lack of original content.\u00a0\nTikTok users often joke that Reels users are slow to adopt trends and behind on current events. One recent viral video about Reels users, posted in November, says, \u201cinstagram reels users just finding out that the submarine imploded,\u201d referencing OceanGate\u2019s Titan submersible that went missing and later found wrecked in June.\u00a0\nMulch is one of the first Reels trends that actually originated on Instagram, and it\u2019s one of the first to translate to other social media platforms\u2019 formats. The meme can exist as a static image of a crusty white dog asking, \u201cwho up mulching?\u201d or as a video narrated by an AI-generated voice extolling the virtues of munching on chemically enriched soil.\u00a0\nIn 2021, i-D predicted that incomprehensible shitposting accounts would prevail over the polished meme accounts that post content for universal appeal. Today, Instagram\u2019s meme culture has largely shifted toward low-effort, text-heavy content that blends confessional captions with seemingly unrelated imagery. A recent post from the Instagram account fembiotic, for example, superimposed the text \u201cmy life is over. (my birthday is coming up)\u201d over a vintage illustration of a cat holding a pink cupcake.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA post shared by magical girl (@fembiotic)\n\nMeme accounts are keeping Instagram relevant in the face of competitors, and naturally, a meme account drove one of the first original Reels trends.\u00a0\nWhether the meme lasts is questionable \u2014 nothing kills a meme faster than going mainstream enough to be co-opted by brands, or worse, being covered by a news outlet \u2014 but the internet absurdism that shapes mulch posts will continue evolving into something weirder and more unexplainable long after mulch loses relevance. By then, it won\u2019t be \u201cGen Alpha humor\u201d or whatever generation comes after. It\u2019ll still be internet absurdism. Until then, Reels can shake its profoundly uncool reputation by leaning into the shitposting.

OpenAI is also looking to set up a local team in India.\nPeople familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that Jaitly\u00a0has been helping OpenAI navigate the Indian policy and regulatory landscape.\nOpenAI currently does not have an official presence in India (apart from a trademark, approved earlier this month). However, OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman visited New Delhi during his world tour in June and met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. After his meeting, Altman said he had a great conversation with Modi. Nevertheless, neither Altman nor the company made any announcements during his two-day visit.\nIt\u2019s not clear if Jaitly is formally employed at OpenAI, but he\u2019s been taking on a role advising the company on how to establish connections in India. He started in the role sometime after Altman\u2019s New Delhi visit, two sources told TechCrunch.\nBetween 2007 and 2009, Jaitly served as head of the public-private partnership for Google in India before moving to Twitter (now called X) in 2012. He was the company\u2019s first employee in the country, according to his LinkedIn profile.\nHe was later elevated to VP for the APAC and MENA region. In late 2016, Jaitly left Twitter and became the co-founder and CEO of Times Bridge, the global investment arm of the Indian media giant The Times Group. Times Bridge\u2019s portfolio includes Uber, Airbnb, Coursera, Mubi, Smule and Wattpad. Jaitly left the firm in 2022.\nOpenAI and Jaitly did not respond to requests for comment.\nOpenAI\u2019s vice president of global affairs, Anna Makanju, is scheduled to speak at the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence summit in Delhi next week, alongside other industry experts and international politicians. She will be a part of the session titled \u201cCollaborative AI for Global Partnership (CAIGP) \u2013 Global Cooperation for Equitable AI.\u201d Sources told TechCrunch that Jaitly assisted in setting up Makanju\u2019s participation at the event.\nRishi Jaitly. Image Credits: Mobile Global Esports\nIn recent weeks, OpenAI\u2019s leadership has been on a roller coaster. First, Altman and board president Greg Brockman were abruptly ousted from the company. The duo joined Microsoft for a hot minute before returning to OpenAI with a revamped board.\nAt an event hosted by Times Group in New Delhi during his June visit, Altman responded to a question about building foundational models with a $10 million budget. It\u2019s \u201chopeless,\u201d he said. (OpenAI has raised a bit more itself \u2014 over $11 billion to date \u2014 to build its foundational models.)\nHis comments met some backlash from Indian entrepreneurs, but Altman clarified later that his words were taken out of context and that he meant it\u2019s hard to compete with the likes of OpenAI with such a budget.\n\u201cThe right question is what a startup can do that\u2019s never been done before, that will contribute a new thing to the world. I have no doubt Indian startups can and will do that,\u201d he said in a post on X.\nthis is really taken out of context! the question was about competing with us with $10 million, which i really do think is not going to work. but i still said try! however, i think it\u2019s the wrong question.\n\u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) June 10, 2023\n\nCritics have described India as severely lagging behind in the world of AI development, not least because of the lack of funding. This piece in September noted that India\u2019s AI startups have raised around $4 billion, which sounds like a big number until you consider the $50 billion that has been poured into the ecosystem in India\u2019s great rival, China; or the $11 billion+ that OpenAI alone has raised (along with the billions more picked up by other large players, and of course the money Big Tech is putting into this).\nA more sympathetic viewpoint might be that India\u2019s AI development is still just nascent, with a few startups such as Sarvam \u2014 which recently raised $41 million from investors including Lightspeed, Peak XV, and Khosla Ventures \u2014 just getting started on building foundational models.\n\u201cWhile there are over 1,500 AI-based startups in India with over $4 billion of funding, India is still losing the AI innovation battle,\u201d analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein said in a note.\nThat leaves a big gap for companies like OpenAI. India, the world\u2019s most populous country and the second-biggest internet market after China, with over 880 million users, presents an opportunity for growth. Altman hinted at the company\u2019s interest in the country during his June visit to the engineering college IIIT Delhi.\n\u201cIt really is amazing to watch what\u2019s happening in India with the embrace of AI \u2014 not just OpenAI but other technologies, too,\u201d he said at the time.\nThat said, the company has yet to disclose any investment in the country (save for the trademark).\nAnd it might not be a fast move. An OpenAI investor told TechCrunch that the company does consider India its key market and is looking to explore opportunities to grow its presence.\nBut with OpenAI\u2019s leadership locked in, now with a more aligned board behind its bolder commercial push, regulation is really one of the last things in the company\u2019s way. And so working on the regulatory front may be the first and most important efforts it can be making right now.\nFor now the task may be more about understanding what direction things will be moving in coming years.\nIndian government officials have indicated multiple times this year that they are not looking to put strict regulations around AI development. India\u2019s IT Minister of State Rajeev Chandrasekhar has repeatedly pushed for international collaboration to develop a framework on regulating AI, with the \u201cguardrails of safety and trust.\u201d\n\u201cWe are very committed to AI,\u201d he said at the Global Technology Summit in New Delhi earlier this week, hosted by Carnegie India and India\u2019s external affairs ministry. \u201cWe certainly are focused on using AI in real-life use cases and our prime minister is absolutely a believer that technology can transform the lives of people, make governments deliver more, deliver faster, deliver better. And so AI is going to be for us used to build models and build capabilities that are aimed at real-life use cases.\u201d\nUnlike OpenAI, its biggest investor and strategic partner Microsoft \u2014 which now has an observer seat on the board \u2014 has a strong hold in India. The software behemoth, which established its local presence in the Indian market back in 1990, has one of its largest R&D centers outside its Redmond headquarters in Bengaluru and three data centers across the country. It has over 20,000 employees across 10 Indian cities. The company is also an active investor in Indian startups.\nWe have contacted OpenAI for comment and will update this post when and if it responds."}, "Google\u2019s AI-assisted NotebookLM note-taking app is now open to users in the US": {"Date": "Dec 08, 2023", "Author": "Aisha Malik", "Category": "Apps", "Type": "This is a Free Article.", "Link": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/08/googles-ai-assisted-notebooklm-note-taking-app-now-open-users-us/", "Content": "Google\u2019s AI note-taking app is now available to all users in the United States who are at least 18 years old, the company announced on Friday. The experimental app is also getting a slew of new features and starting to use Gemini Pro, Google\u2019s new large language model, to \u201chelp with document understanding and reasoning.\u201d\nOnce you upload documents to NotebookLM, the app can automatically generate summaries and suggest follow-up questions about the content in the documents. Unlike generic chatbots that draw on large amounts of unrelated information, NotebookLM solely focuses on the documents that it is fed.\nNow, Google is adding new capabilities to the product to go beyond generating summaries and suggesting questions.\nNotebookLM now has new tools designed to help users organize their curated notes into structured writing projects. For instance, you can select a set of notes and ask NotebookLM to create something new, such as a script outline, email newsletter or a draft of a marketing plan.\nPlus, NotebookLM can now suggest actions based on whatever you\u2019re currently doing. For instance, say you have selected a passage while reading a source. NotebookLM will automatically offer to summarize the text that you have selected into a new note or help you understand the content of the text. In another instance, say you\u2019re writing a note. NotebookLM will offer to refine your prose or suggest related ideas from your sources based on what you have written so far.\nImage Credits: Google\nThe tech giant is adding a new noteboard space to let you easily pin quotes from the chat or your own written notes. Google says the new space was a key request from users who said they wanted the ability to save their exchanges with NotebookLM as notes.\nGoogle is also making a few other small tweaks to the product. Now when you add a note, NotebookLM will create an independent new note instead of adding to a single notepad. And when you click on the citation number in a chat response or a saved note, you will now immediately be taken to the original quote in the source.\nIf you want to concentrate exclusively on notetaking, you can now hide the source. And if you want to focus NotebookLM\u2019s AI on selected sources, you can chat with a specific set of sources in your notebook by selecting them individually in the source sidebar. Plus, Google is adding PDF support and copied text support, which means you can now copy and paste text to create a new source and edit the title once it\u2019s created.\nIn addition to the new features, Google is also expanding the product\u2019s limitations, as notebooks can now include up to 20 sources, while a source can now include up to 200,000 words.\nToday\u2019s announcement comes around five months after the tech giant made NotebookLM available to a select few. Google first demoed its \u201cAI notebook for everyone\u201d during Google I/O earlier this year as Project Tailwind before renaming it to NotebookLM. At the time, Google said the app could be used by students as a way to organize their lecture notes and other documents when completing coursework.\nNotebookLM is promising, but as TechCrunch\u2019s Devin Coldeway previously noted, let\u2019s hope the product doesn\u2019t end up in the Google Graveyard like so many of the tech giant\u2019s other experimental projects.\nGoogle\u2019s AI-assisted note-taking app gets limited launch as NotebookLM\n"}, "X\u2019s AI chatbot Grok now \u2018rolled out to all\u2019 US Premium+ subscribers, English language users are next": {"Date": "Dec 08, 2023", "Author": "Sarah Perez", "Category": "Apps", "Type": "This is a Free Article.", "Link": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/08/xs-ai-chatbot-grok-now-rolled-out-to-all-u-s-premium-subscribers-english-language-users-are-next/", "Content": "Yesterday, X began rolling out Grok, the \u201crebellious\u201d AI chatbot developed by Elon Musk\u2019s xAI startup, to Premium+ subscribers on X\u2019s platform.

On November 22, for instance, Musk said that xAI\u2019s Grok would launch to Premium+ subscribers \u201cnext week,\u201d but the chatbot actually launched this week, on December 7.\nWhether or not the chatbot is a success in driving subscription revenue for X still remains to be seen. For now, Grok is only part of X\u2019s top-tier subscription offering \u2014 the $16 per month Premium+. That\u2019s much pricier than X\u2019s Basic ($3/mo) and Premium ($8/mo) options, and it\u2019s not clear it will appeal to casual AI dabblers who can use rival chatbots like ChatGPT or Google\u2019s Bard for free.\nThe Premium+ subscription comes with access to other features to broaden its appeal, including the benefit of seeing no advertisements in the For You and Following timelines on X. Premium+ users also have their replies boosted the most, in addition to all of Premium\u2019s features like ads revenue sharing for creators, ID verification, a verified checkmark, access to Media Studio and more.\nBut so far, subscriptions haven\u2019t driven the majority of X, formerly Twitter\u2019s revenue \u2014 advertising has.\nYet now, it\u2019s unclear what X\u2019s ad-supported future may look like as Musk has been alienating X\u2019s advertisers \u2014 even telling them to \u201cfuck yourself\u201d for leaving X over concerns of antisemitic content on the site. For X to be sustainable, it may need a larger number of users to subscribe to Premium+ for Grok to help shore up the loss of ad dollars as brands like Apple, Disney, IBM, Paramount, Walmart and others flee the platform.\nOf note, X had its largest-ever month for subscription revenue in November, pulling in $6.2 million in net revenue, after app store fees, according to one estimate by app intelligence provider Apptopia. However, that\u2019s still less than a third of what Snapchat made for its own in-app subscription, which topped $20 million for the first time last month.\nIn other words, there\u2019s still plenty of room for X to grow subscribers, given it reportedly has more than 500 million monthly active users.

As it turns out, many of Snapchat\u2019s younger users are willing to pay for the perks of Snapchat+, which offers tools to enhance stories, pin a Best Friend and change the app icon, as well as gain early access to new features, including new AI features, and much more. In November, the subscription offering topped $20 million in net revenue (after app store fees) for the first time, while subscription revenue rose by double digits in almost every country where Snapchat+ is live.\nThat puts Snapchat+ far ahead of X Premium, the subscription product formerly known as Twitter Blue. In November, X saw its highest month of in-app revenue purchase to date with $6.2 million in consumer spending, but it was still less than a third of what Snapchat+ is bringing in.\nImage Credits: Apptopia\nThese findings, which come from app intelligence provider Apptopia, follow Snap\u2019s announcement in September that its subscription offering had reached a milestone of over 5 million subscribers. That was up from 4 million\u00a0in late June and\u00a03 million in mid-April. Demand for the product had shown no signs of slowing, especially as the company introduced more early access features, including Snap\u2019s latest AI products, like its My AI chatbot which rolled out to subscribers first, and expanded access to a generative AI selfie feature called Dreams. The My AI chatbot has been used to send over 20 billion messages, Snap announced during its Q3 earnings.\nAs a result, Snapchat+ is continuing to add subscribers for its now more-than-a-year-old subscription. Notes Apptopia, the subscription pulled in a total of more than $31 million in consumer spending before app store commissions, and was up 23.4% month-over-month, compared with October. While this wasn\u2019t the largest-ever monthly increase as a percentage, it was the second-largest in terms of absolute revenue growth.\nThe top markets fueling the subscription\u2019s consumer spending include the U.S., U.K., France, Australia and Canada. The U.S.\u2019s net revenue led the month in November, growing from $1.3 million to $1.8 million. This was followed by the U.K. ($1.6 million net), France ($1.2 million net), Australia ($1 million net), and Canada ($960,000 net). Or, more simply put, the top 4 countries generated north of $1 million in revenue each for the Snapchat+ subscription.\nPlus, the subscription is finding traction in unexpected areas as well, Apptopia found. For example, Saudi Arabia is the No. 7 market by consumer spending \u2014 something that isn\u2019t common.\nWhat\u2019s more, this data doesn\u2019t even offer the full picture for Snapchat+, as the company has made it possible for U.S. users to pay for a Snapchat+ subscription via gift cards sold on Amazon. Because those purchases are taking place outside the app stores, a third party like Apptopia wouldn\u2019t be able to track that spending.

In their early years, most tech companies are financed by venture capital, specifically designed to fund enterprises that lose money initially, taking significant risks (and big losses) to ultimately realize outsize profits.\n \n\n\t\t\tThe interest rate trajectory has been more stable over the past few months.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThis affair is still true today, and high growth is the primary indicator of a young company\u2019s ability to eventually generate significant future cash flows. This is true in all interest rate environments. However, the nuance is that with higher rates, the value of future cash flows is discounted at a higher rate (worth less today), so the relative value of huge outsized future returns versus current losses is more muted.\nThe interest rate trajectory has been more stable over the past few months. At this elevated but not astronomical level, tech leaders should continue to emphasize investment and projects that will drive growth. Still, they should do so with more visibility \u2014 and tighter timelines to realize the benefits. Specifically, this means funding projects (often in product builds) with clear \u2014 at minimum \u2014 medium-term (six to 18 months) paths to increasing revenue and/or lowering costs.\nThis does not mean ignoring projects that impact only user experience; those are always relevant, but it means, for example, being clear on how that user experience improvement will drive product engagement that, in turn, moves a desirable metric (which in turn likely impacts revenue or cost). Explicitly state that metric movement and hold the project leaders accountable for it.\n "}, "Ex-Uber CSO Joe Sullivan on why he \u2018had to get over\u2019 shock of data breach conviction": {"Date": "Dec 08, 2023", "Author": "Carly Page", "Category": "Security", "Type": "This is a Free Article.", "Link": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/08/ex-uber-cso-joe-sullivan-on-why-he-had-to-get-over-shock-data-breach-conviction/", "Content": "Before joining Uber as chief security officer in 2015, Joe Sullivan served for two years as a federal prosecutor with the United States Department of Justice, where he specialized in computer hacking and IP issues. He worked on a number of high-profile cases, from the first case in the U.S. of prosecution\u00a0under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to the prosecution of a hacker who breached NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nMore than 20 years after joining the U.S. government to help organizations defend against the so-called bad guys, Sullivan found himself on the other side of the justice system.\nIn October 2022, a San Francisco jury found him guilty on charges of obstructing an official proceeding and misprision of a felony (a failure-to-report-wrongdoing offense). In May this year, Sullivan was sentenced to three years probation.\nThe irony is not lost on Sullivan, who spoke to TechCrunch in London this week prior to his keynote speech at the cybersecurity conference Black Hat Europe.\nThis precedent-setting case pertains to a breach of Uber\u2019s systems in 2016, where hackers threatened to expose the data of 50 million Uber customers and drivers. The verdict centered primarily around Uber\u2019s decision not to report the breach to the Federal Trade Commission, as the company was mandated to report all breaches after an earlier 2014 hack of its systems exposed the names and driver\u2019s license numbers of 50,000 people.\nThe case didn\u2019t go as Sullivan, who was fired from Uber in 2017, had expected.\n\u201cWe thought we were going to win the trial. We barely put on a defense because my lawyers were like, \u2018we don\u2019t need to.\u2019 I didn\u2019t testify, so the jury never saw me. They just saw the anonymous Uber executive with a mask on,\u201d Sullivan told TechCrunch during the interview on Wednesday.\nThe first-of-its-kind verdict hit Sullivan hard initially. \u201cWhen I lost the trial last October, I was in a funk, I didn\u2019t want to talk to anybody, and I didn\u2019t know what would happen to my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wanted to curl up in a ball.\u201d\nSullivan\u2019s case also caused anxiety among fellow CSOs and CISOs, a number of whom wrote letters to the case\u2019s sentencing judge, William Orrick, praising Sullivan\u2019s actions and voicing their fears that they too could face legal penalties for simply doing their jobs.\n\u201cJoe\u2019s case has had a huge impact on the cybersecurity community,\u201d one letter, signed by more than 50 CISOs, read. \u201cIt has been the subject of frequent executive team conversations and panel discussions at industry seminars, and a significant driver of efforts to change policies and practices to err on the side of disclosure, even when the legal requirement to do so remains unsettled.\u201d\nThese fears have lasted long beyond Sullivan\u2019s conviction. The former Uber CSO, who now works as CEO at a nonprofit dedicated to providing humanitarian and technology aid to the people of Ukraine, told TechCrunch that he receives calls every week from security professionals asking whether they should stay in the industry and whether they should take interviews for higher-ranking roles that come with greater responsibility \u2014 and greater risk.\n\u201cWhat I tell the security executives right now is that they shouldn\u2019t run away from the job \u2014 they should run towards it,\u201d Sullivan said, noting that the shared anxiety among cybersecurity professionals, along with the fact that he wanted to be a \u201cbetter person,\u201d is part of the reason he wanted to start speaking out about the Uber data breach case.\n\u201cI realized that sharing what I\u2019ve gone through is better than not, and healthier for me. It\u2019s taken me a year to say that, but that\u2019s the right way to be,\u201d Sullivan told TechCrunch. \u201cI was very bitter, but I want to be a better person. I also want to continue being part of the security world, so I have to get over it.\u201d\nSullivan told TechCrunch that another reason he\u2019s keen to speak out is because of the fact that there have been \u201c100 webinars, by 100 lawyers, saying that \u2018you won\u2019t end up like Joe if you have insurance, if you bring legal and PR into the room, or if you have a breach responsibility policy.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cWe did all of those things [at Uber],\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cWe had insurance; there was a data breach response policy; we looped in PR, and the CEO [Travis Kalanick] signed off on everything, including the dollar amount,\u201d he added, referring to the $100,000 payment that was made to the two young men that discovered the vulnerability that led to the 2016 Uber breach.\nWhen asked whether he believed Uber\u2019s then-CEO should have been held responsible, Sullivan said: \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody did anything wrong at the end of the day.\u201d\n\u201cUber wouldn\u2019t exist today \u2014 in fact, we would still be taking taxis \u2014 if it wasn\u2019t for [Kalanick] and his sheer forcefulness,\u201d Sullivan added. \u201cOn the upside, he drove some change in the world. However, on the downside, his philosophy was that the person who threw the first punch wins the fight.\u201d\nIn what Sullivan describes as \u201cthe greatest irony of his career,\u201d part of his role at the Department of Justice involved him working closely with organizations in Silicon Valley in order to encourage more collaboration with the government. \u201cThat\u2019s been the story of my career; trying to get the public and private sectors to work together.\u201d\nSullivan believes that going forward, this public-private sector collaboration, along with strong regulation, is the only way to fix the \u201cbroken\u201d cybersecurity industry.\n\u201cWhen I joined, [Uber] had the worst security of any $40 billion company, and that can\u2019t fly in the world anymore. If you\u2019re going to sell a product, your security has to be good enough the day you sell it,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cI could be very bitter about the idea of government regulation since I was regulated, but I also think we need it for the internet to work well in the future.\u201d\nSullivan praised the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission\u2019s incoming data breach disclosure rules, which come into effect on December 15, noting that while not perfect, it\u2019s much better than having zero guidance. \u201cWe can nitpick the details as much as we want, but this is the right way to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI seem to be the person who\u2019s criticizing the SEC less than everyone else because I think we should praise them for trying to make rules.\u201d\nAs for CSOs and CISOs, many of whom are still worried that they\u2019ll be held personally liable for security failings at their organization, Sullivan believes that now is the time to speak out in order to shape any future regulation.\n\u201cWe have to pull ourselves up, we have to learn the policy side of it, and we have to learn how to make our voice heard,\u201d Sullivan told TechCrunch. \u201cI think we have to develop leaders who can be real societal leaders who are experts in our profession.\u201d"}, "SaaS goes to space as some software startups are in a race to survive": {"Date": "Dec 08, 2023", "Author": "Alex Wilhelm,\u00a0\t\t\t\t\tMary Ann Azevedo,\u00a0\t\t\t\t\tKirsten Korosec,\u00a0\t\t\t\t\tTheresa Loconsolo", "Category": "Commerce", "Type": "This is a Free Article.", "Link": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/08/saas-in-space/", "Content": "\nListen here or\u00a0wherever you get your podcasts.\nHello and welcome back to\u00a0Equity, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.\nThis is our Friday show, and today, Mary Ann Azevedo, Kirsten Korosec and Alex Wilhelm got together to go over the week\u2019s biggest tech and startup news:\nFor episode transcripts and more, head to\u00a0Equity\u2019s Simplecast website.\nEquity drops at 7 a.m. PT every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, so subscribe to us on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Overcast,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0and\u00a0all the casts.
